Algorithms commonly used in the analysis of such large-scale data often depend on a complete set. Missing value imputation offers a solution to this problem. However, the majority of available imputation methods are restricted to one type of variable only: continuous or categorical. For mixed-type data, the different types are usually handled separately. Therefore, these methods ignore possible relations between variable},

GAMLSS allows any parametric distribution for the response variable and modelling all the parameters (location, scale and shape) of the distribution as linear or smooth functions of explanatory variables. This book provides a broad overview of GAMLSS methodology and how it is implemented in R. It includes a comprehensive collection of real data examples, integrated code, and figures to illustrate the methods, and is supplemented by a website with code, data and additional materials.},

	Abstract = {In contrast to therapeutic research guidance to design, conduct, analyse and report studies on prognostic factors is less developed and often several deficiencies are stressed. For the assessment of the importance of a factor of interest a systematic review of the corresponding studies would be required, however, this is hardly possible because of many weaknesses in the individual studies. In this article I will discuss several deficiencies of the analysis of prognostic factor studies and shortly discuss problems of reporting and of a summary assessment. By using 3 studies in cancer and a hypotheitcal study as examples I will discuss categorization respectively the determination of a functional form for a continuous factor, sample size, multivariable analysis and data quality. The message of this paper is that serious improvements of prognostic factor studies are required. This can be achieved by a closer collaboration between several disciplines and a closer collaboration at the international level. Specifically, experienced statisticians have to play a central role in the planning, analysis, interpretation and reporting of these studies. Copyright {\textordfeminine} 2005 S. Karger AG},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with problems concerning missing data in statistical databases. Multiple imputation is a statistically sound technique for handling incomplete data. Two problems should be addressed before the routine application of the technique becomes feasible. First, if imputations are to be appropriate for more than one statistical analysis, they should be generated independently of any scientific models that are to be applied to the data at a later stage. This is done by finding imputations that will extrapolate the structure of the data, as well as the uncertainty about this structure. A second problem is to use complete-data methods in an efficient way. The HERMES workstation encapsulates existing statistical packages in a client-server model. It forms a natural and convenient environment for implementing multiple imputation},

	Abstract = {A logistic regression classification algorithm is developed for problems in which the feature vectors may be missing data (features). Single or multiple imputation for the missing data is avoided by performing analytic integration with an estimated conditional density function (conditioned on the non-missing data). Conditional density functions are estimated using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM), with parameter estimation performed using both expectation maximization (EM) and Variational Bayesian EM (VB-EM). Using widely available real data, we demonstrate the general advantage of the VB-EM GMM estimation for handling incomplete data, vis-{\`a}-vis the EM algorithm. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the approach proposed here is generally superior to standard imputation procedures},
