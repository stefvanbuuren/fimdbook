This chapter changes the perspective to the rows of the data matrix. An
important consequence of nonresponse and missing data is that the
remaining sample may not be representative any more. Multiple imputation
of entire blocks of variables (Section \@ref(sec:selective)) can be useful
to adjust for selective loss of cases in panel and cohort studies.
Section \@ref(sec:nonresponse) takes this idea a step further by appended
and imputing new synthetic records to the data. This can also work for
cross-sectional studies.

## Correcting for selective drop-out {#sec:selective}

Panel attrition is a problem that plagues all studies in which the same
people are followed over time. People who leave the study are called
*drop-outs*. The persons who drop out may be systematically different
from those who remain, thus providing an opportunity for bias. This
section assumes that the drop-out mechanism is MAR and that the
parameters of the complete-data model and the response mechanism are
distinct (cf. Section \@ref(sec:ignorable)). Techniques for nonignorable
drop-outs are described by @LITTLE1995, @DIGGLE2002, @DANIELS2008 and
@WU2010.

### POPS study: 19 years follow-up

The Project on Preterm and Small for Gestational Age Infants (POPS) is
an ongoing collaborative study in the Netherlands on the long-term
effect of prematurity and dysmaturity on medical, psychological and
social outcomes. The cohort was started in 1983 and enrolled 1338
infants with a gestational age below 32 weeks or with a birth weight
of below 1500 grams [@VERLOOVE1986]. Of this cohort, 312 infants died
in the first 28 days, and another 67 children died between the ages of
28 days and 19 years, leaving 959 survivors at the age of 19 years.
Intermediate outcome measures from earlier follow-ups were available
for 89% of the survivors at age 14 ($n$ = 854), 77% at age 10 ($n$ =
712), 84% at age 9 ($n$ = 813), 96% at age 5 ($n$ = 927) and 97% at age
2 ($n$ = 946).

To study the effect of drop-out, @HILLE2005 divided the 959 survivors
into three response groups:

1.  *Full responders* were examined at an outpatient clinic and
    completed the questionnaires ($n$ = 596);

2.  *Postal responders* only completed the mailed questionnaires
    ($n$ = 109);

3.  *Nonresponders* did not respond to any of the mailed requests or
    telephone calls, or could not be traced ($n$ = 254).

### Characterization of the drop-out

Of the 254 nonresponders, 38 children (15%) did not comply because
they were “physically or mentally unable to participate in the
assessment.” About half of the children (132, 52%) refused to
participate. No reason for drop-out was known for 84 children (33%).

response groups. Source: @HILLE2005.

Table \@ref(tab:pops) lists some of the major differences between the
three response groups. Compared to the postal and nonresponders, the
full response group consists of more girls, contains more Dutch
children, has higher educational and social economic levels and has
fewer handicaps. Clearly, the responders form a highly selective
subgroup in the total cohort.

Differential drop-out from the less healthy children leads to an
obvious underestimate of disease prevalence. For example, the
incidence of handicaps would be severely underestimated if based on
data from the full responders only. In addition, selective drop-out
could bias regression parameters in predictive models if the reason
for drop-out is related to the outcome of interest. This may happen,
for example, if we try to predict handicaps at the age of 19 years
from the full responders only. Thus, statistical parameters may be
difficult to interpret in the presence of selective drop-out.

### Imputation model {#sec:popsmodel}

```{r popreaddata, echo = FALSE}
```

The primary interest of the investigators focused on 14 different
outcomes at 19 years: cognition, hearing, vision, neuromotor
functioning, ADHD, respiratory symptoms, height, BMI, health status
(Health Utilities Index Mark 3), perceived health (London Handicap
Scale), coping, self-efficacy, educational attainment and occupational
activities. Since it is inefficient to create a multiply imputed
dataset for each outcome separately, the goal is to construct one set
of imputed data that is used for all analyses.

For each outcome, the investigator created a list of potentially
relevant predictors according to the predictor selection strategy set
forth in Section \@ref(sec:predictors). In total, this resulted in a
set of 85 unique variables. Only four of these were completely
observed for all 959 children. Moreover, the information provided by
the investigators was coded (in Microsoft Excel) as an 85 $\times$ 85
predictor matrix that is used to define the imputation model.

```{r POPSpredictor, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:POPSpredictor)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/ch10_predictormatrix.png")
```

(ref:POPSpredictor) The 85 $\times$ 85 predictor matrix used in the
POPS study. The gray parts signal the column variables that are used
to impute the row variable.

Figure \@ref(fig:POPSpredictor) shows a miniature version of the
predictor matrix. The dark cell indicates that the column variable is
used to impute the row variable. Note the four complete variables with
rows containing only zeroes. There are three blocks of variables. The
first nine variables (Set 1: `geslacht`-`sga`) are potential
confounders that should be controlled for in all analyses. The second
set of variables (Set 2: `grad.t`-`sch910r`) are variables measured at
intermediate time points that appear in specific models. The third set
of variables (Set 3: `iq`-`occrec`) are the incomplete outcomes of
primary interest collected at the age of 19 years. The imputation
model is defined such that:

1.  All variables in Set 1 are used as predictors to impute Set 1, to
    preserve relations between them;

2.  All variables in Set 1 are used as predictors to impute Set 3,
    because all variables in Set 1 appear in the complete-data models of
    Set 3;

3.  All variables in Set 3 are used as predictors to impute Set 3, to
    preserve the relation between the variables measured at age 19;

4.  Selected variables in Set 2 that appear in complete-data models are
    used as predictors to impute specific variables in Set 3;

5.  Selected variables in Set 3 are “mirrored” to impute incomplete
    variables in Set 2, so as to maintain consistency between Set 2 and
    Set 3 variables;

6.  The variable `geslacht` (sex) is included in all imputation models.

This setup of the predictor matrix avoids fitting unwieldy imputation
models, while maintaining the relations of scientific interest.

### A solution “that does not look good” {#sec:degenerate}

The actual imputations can be produced by

```{r popimpute, cache = TRUE}
```

```{r popstrace, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 4/7, fig.cap = '(ref:popstrace)'}
```

(ref:popstrace) Trace lines of the MICE algorithm for the variable
`a10u` illustrating problematic convergence.

The number of iterations is set to 20 because the trace lines from the
MICE algorithm show strong initial trends and slow mixing.

Figure \@ref(fig:popstrace) plots the trace lines of the binary
variable `a10u`, an indicator of visual disabilities. The behavior of
these trace lines looks suspect, especially for `a10u`. The mean of
`a10u` (left side) of the imputed values converges to a value near
1.9, while the standard deviation (right side) drops below that
variability that is found in the data. Since the categories are coded
as `1 = no problem` and `2 = problem`, a value of 1.9 actually implies
that 90% of the nonresponders would have a problem. The observed
prevalence of `a10u` in the full responders is only 1.5%, so 90% is
clearly beyond any reasonable value.

```{r popsbwplot1, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 4/7, fig.cap = '(ref:popsbwplot1)'}
```

(ref:popsbwplot1) Distributions (observed and imputed) of IQ and
coping score at 19 years in the POPS study for the imputation model in
Figure \@ref(fig:POPSpredictor).

In addition, `iq` and `coping` move into remote territories. Figure
\@ref(fig:popsbwplot1) illustrates that the imputed values for `iq`
appear unreasonably low, whereas for `coping` they appear unreasonably
high. What is happening here?

The phenomenon we see illustrates a weakness (or feature) of the MICE
algorithm that manifests itself when the imputation model is
overparametrized relative to the available information. The source of
the problem lies in the imputation of the variables in Set 3, the
measurements at 19 years. We specified that all variables in Set 3
should impute each other, with the idea of preserving the multivariate
relations between these variables. For 254 out of 959 children
(26.5%), we do not have any information at age 19. The MICE algorithm
starts out by borrowing information from the group of responders, and
then quickly finds out that it can create imputations that are highly
correlated. However, the imputed values do not look at all like the
observed data, and are more like multivariate outliers that live in an
extreme part of the data space.

There are several ways to alleviate the problem. The easiest approach
is to remove the 254 nonresponders from the data. This is a sensible
approach if the analysis focuses on determinants of 19-year outcomes,
but it is not suitable for making inferences on the marginal outcome
distribution of the entire cohort. A second approach is to simplify
the model. Many of the 19-year outcomes are categorical, and we reduce
the number of parameters drastically by applying predictive mean
matching to these outcomes. A third approach would be to impute all
outcomes as a block. This would find potential donors among the
observed data, and impute all outcomes simultaneously. This removes
the risk of artificially inflating the relations among outcomes, and
is a promising alternative. Finally, the approach we follow here is to
simplify the imputation model by removing the gray block in the
lower-right part of Figure \@ref(fig:POPSpredictor). The relation
between the outcomes would then only be maintained through their
relation with predictors measured at other time points. It is easy to
change and rerun the model as:

```{r impute2, cache = TRUE}
```

These statements produce imputations with marginal distributions much
closer to the observed data. Also, the trace lines now show normal
behavior (not shown). Convergence occurs rapidly in about 5-10
iterations.

```{r popsbwplot2, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 4/7, fig.cap = '(ref:popsbwplot2)'}
```

(ref:popsbwplot2) Distributions (observed and imputed) of IQ and
coping score at 19 years in the POPS study for the simplified
imputation model.

Figure \@ref(fig:popsbwplot2) displays the distributions of IQ and coping.
The nonrespondents have slightly lower IQ scores, but not as extreme as
in Figure \@ref(fig:popsbwplot1). There are now hardly any differences in
coping.

### Results

Table \@ref(tab:popsprev) provides estimates of the percentage of
three health problems, both uncorrected and corrected for selective
drop-out. As expected, all estimates are adjusted upward. Note that
the prevalence of visual problems tripled to 4.7% after correction.
While this increase is substantial, it is well within the range of
odds ratios of 2.6 and 4.4 reported by @HILLE2005. The adjustment
shows that prevalence estimates in the whole group can be
substantially higher than in the group of full responders. @HILLE2007
provide additional and more detailed results.

### Conclusion

Many studies are plagued by selective drop-out. Multiple imputation
provides an intuitive way to adjust for drop-out, thus enabling
estimation of statistics relative to the entire cohort rather than the
subgroup. The method assumes MAR. The formulation of the imputation
model requires some care. Section \@ref(sec:popsmodel) outlines a
simple strategy to specify the predictor matrix to fit an imputation
model for multiple uses. This methodology is easily adapted to other
studies.

Section \@ref(sec:degenerate) illustrates that multiple imputation is
not without dangers. The imputations produced by the initial model
were far off, which underlines the importance of diagnostic evaluation
of the imputed data. A disadvantage of the approach taken to alleviate
the problem is that it preserves the relations between the variables
in Set 3 only insofar as they are related through their common
predictors. These relations may thus be attenuated. Some alternatives
were highlighted, and an especially promising one is to impute blocks
of variables (cf. Section \@ref(sec:blockvar)). Whatever is done, it
is important to diagnose aberrant algorithmic behavior, and decide on
an appropriate strategy to prevent it given the scientific questions
at hand.

## Correcting for nonresponse {#sec:nonresponse}

This section describes how multiple imputation can be used to “make a
sample representative.” Weighting to known population totals is widely
used to correct for nonresponse [@BETHLEHEM2002; @SARNDAL2005].
Imputation is an alternative to weighting. Imputation provides
fine-grained control over the correction process. Provided that the
imputation method is confidence proper, estimation of the correct
standard errors can be done using Rubin’s rules. Note however that
this is not without controversy: @MARKER2002 [p. 332] criticize
multiple imputation as “difficult to apply,” “to require massive
amounts of computation,” and question its performance for clustered
datasets and unplanned analyses. Weighting and multiple imputation can
also be combined, as was done in the NHANES III imputation project
[@KHARE1993; @SCHAFER1996].

This section demonstrates an application in the situation where the
nonresponse is assumed to depend on known covariates, and where the
distribution of covariates in the population is known. The sample is
augmented by a set of artificial records, the outcomes in this set are
multiply imputed and the whole set is analyzed. Though the application
assumes random sampling, it should not be difficult to extend the
basic ideas to more complex sampling designs.

### Fifth Dutch Growth Study

The Fifth Dutch Growth Study is a cross-sectional nationwide study of
height, weight and other anthropometric measurements among children
0-21 years living in the Netherlands [@SCHONBECK2013]. The goal of the
study is to provide updated growth charts that are representative for
healthy children. The study is an update of similar studies performed
in the Netherlands in 1955, 1965, 1980 and 1997. A strong secular
trend in height has been observed over the last 150 years, making the
Dutch population the tallest in the world [@FREDRIKS2000B]. The growth
studies yield essential information needed to calibrate the growth
charts for monitoring childhood growth and development. One of the
parameters of interest is *final height*, the mean height of the
population when fully grown around the age of 20 years.

The survey took place between May 2008 and October 2009. The sample
was stratified into five regions: North (Groningen, Friesland,
Drenthe), East (Overijssel, Gelderland, Flevoland), West
(Noord-Holland, Zuid-Holland, Utrecht), South (Zeeland, Noord-Brabant,
Limburg) and the four major cities (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague,
Utrecht City). The way in which the children were sampled depended on
age. Up to 8 years of age, measurements were performed during regular
periodical health examinations. Children older than 9 years were
sampled from the population register, and received a personal
invitation from the local health care provider.

The total population was stratified into three ethnic subpopulations.
Here we consider only the subpopulation of Dutch descent. This group
consists of all children whose biological parents are born in the
Netherlands. Children with growth-related diseases were excluded. The
planned sample size for the Dutch subpopulation was equal to 14782.

### Nonresponse

During data collection, it quickly became evident that the response in
children older than 15 years was extremely poor, and sometimes fell
even below 20%. Though substantial nonresponse was caused by lack of
perceived interest by the children, we could not rule out the
possibility of selective nonresponse. For example, overweight children
may have been less inclined to participate. The data collection method
was changed in November 2008 so that all children with a school class
were measured. Once a class was selected, nonresponse of the pupils
was very generally small. In addition, children were measured by
special teams at two high schools, two universities and a youth
festival. The sample was supplemented with data from two studies from
Amsterdam and Zwolle.

### Comparison to known population totals

The realized sample size was $n$ = 10030 children aged 0-21 years
(4829 boys, 5201 girls). The nonresponse and the changes in the design
may have biased the sample. If the sample is to be representative for
the Netherlands, then the distribution of measured covariates like
age, sex, region or educational level should conform to known
population totals. Such population totals are based on administrative
sources and are available in STATLINE, the online publication system
of Statistics Netherlands.

Table \@ref(tab:cbs) compares the proportion of children within five
geographical regions in the Netherlands per January 1, 2010, with the
proportions in the sample. Geography is known to be related to height,
with the 20-year-olds in the North being about 3cm taller in the North
[@FREDRIKS2000B]. There are three age groups. In the youngest
children, the population and sample proportions are reasonably close
in the East, South and West, but there are too few children from the
North and the major cities. For children aged 10-13 years, there are
too few children from the North and East. In the oldest children, the
sample underrepresents the North and the major cities, and
overrepresents the East.

the measured children. The table also reports the number of children
needed to bring the sample close to the population distribution.

In total 1975 records are appended to the 10030 records of children
who were measured. The appended data contain three complete
covariates: region, sex and age in years. For example, for the
combination (`North`, `0-9 years`) $n_{\rm imp}$ = 400 new records are
created as follows. All 400 records have the region category `North`.
The first 200 records are boys and the last 200 records are girls. Age
is drawn uniformly from the range 0-9 years. The outcomes of interest,
like height and weight, are set to missing. Similar blocks of records
are created for the other five categories of interest, resulting in a
total of 1975 new records with complete covariates and missing
outcomes.

The following `R` code creates a dataset of 1975 records, with four
complete covariates (`id`, `reg`, `sex`, `age`) and four missing
outcomes (`hgt`, `wgt`, `hgt.z`, `wgt.z`). The outcomes `hgt.z` and
`wgt.z` are standard deviation scores (SDS), or $Z$-scores, derived
from `hgt` and `wgt`, respectively, standardized for age and sex
relative to the Dutch references [@FREDRIKS2000B].

### Imputation model {#imputation-model}

```{r sdsbyregion, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 4/7, fig.cap = '(ref:sdsbyregion)'}
```

(ref:sdsbyregion) Height SDS by age and region of Dutch children.
Source: Fifth Dutch Growth Study ($n$ = 10030).

Regional differences in height are not constant across age, and tend
to be more pronounced in older children. Figure \@ref(fig:sdsbyregion)
displays mean height standard deviation scores by age and region.
Children from the North are generally the tallest, while those from
the South are shortest, but the difference varies somewhat with age.
Children from the major cities are short at early ages, but relatively
tall in the oldest age groups. Imputation should preserve these
features in the data, so we need to include at least the age by region
interaction into the imputation model. In addition, we incorporate the
interaction between SDS and age, so that the relation between height
and weight could differ across age. The following specification uses
the new `formulas` argument of `mice` to specify the interaction
terms. This setup eliminates the need for passive imputation.

```{r vlgimpute, cache = TRUE}
```

Height SDS and weight SDS are is approximately normally distributed
with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1, so we use the
linear normal model method `norm` rather the `pmm`. If necessary,
absolute values in centimeters (cm) and kilograms (kg) can be
calculated after imputation.

```{r vlginspect, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 4/7, fig.cap = '(ref:vlginspect)'}
```

(ref:vlginspect) Mean height SDS by age for regions `North` and
`City`, in the observed data ($n$ = 10030) (blue) and 10 augmented
datasets that correct for the nonresponse ($n$ = 12005).

Figure \@ref(fig:vlginspect) displays mean height SDS per year for
regions `North` and `City` in the original and augmented data. The 10
imputed datasets show patterns in mean height SDS similar to those in
the observed data. Because of the lower sample size, the means for
region `North` are more variable than `City`. Observe also that the
rising pattern in `City` is reproduced in the imputed data. No
imputations were generated for the ages 10-13 years, which explains
that the means of the imputed and observed data coincide. The
imputations tend to smooth out sharp peaks at higher ages due to the
low number of data points.

### Influence of nonresponse on final height {#sec:finalheight}

```{r finalheight, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 4/7, fig.cap = '(ref:finalheight)'}
```

(ref:finalheight) Final height estimates in Dutch boys and girls from
the original sample ($n$ = 10030) and 10 augmented samples ($n$ =
12005) that correct for the nonresponse.

Figure \@ref(fig:finalheight) displays the mean of fitted height
distribution of the original and the 10 imputed datasets. Since
children from the shorter population in the South are overrepresented,
the estimates of final height from the sample (183.6 cm for boys,
170.6 cm for girls) are biased downward. The estimates calculated from
the imputed data vary from 183.6 to 184.1 cm (boys) and 170.6 to
171.1 cm (girls). Thus, correcting for the nonresponse leads to final
height estimates that are about 2 mm higher.

### Discussion

The application as described here only imputes height and weight in
Dutch children. It is straightforward to extend the method to impute
additional outcomes, like waist or hip circumference.

The method can only correct for covariates whose distributions are
known in both the sample and population. It does not work if
nonresponse depends on factors for which we have no population
distribution. However, if we have possession of nonresponse forms for
a representative sample, we may use any covariates common to the
responders and nonresponders to correct for the nonresponse using a
similar methodology. The correction will be more successful if these
covariates are related to the reasons for the nonresponse.

There are no accepted methods yet to calculate the number of extra
records needed. Here we used 1975 new records to augment the existing
10030 records, about 16% of the total. This number of artificial
records brought the covariate distribution in the augmented sample
close to the population distribution without the need to discard any
of the existing records. When the imbalance grows, we may need a
higher percentage of augmentation. The estimates will then be based on
a larger fraction of missing information, and may thus become
unstable. Alternatively, we could sacrifice some of the existing
records by taking a random subsample of strata that are
overrepresented, but discarding data is likely to lead it less
efficient estimates. It would be interesting to compare the
methodology to traditional weighting approaches.

## Exercises {#ex:ch:selection}

```{exercise, name = "90th centile", label = "90thcentile"}
Repeat the analysis in Section \@ref(sec:finalheight) for final
height. Study the effect of omitting the interaction effect from the
imputation model. Are the effects on the 90th centile the same as for
the mean?
```

```{exercise, name = "How many records?", label = "howmanyrecords"}
Section \@ref(sec:augmentsample) describes an application in which
incomplete records are appended to create a representative sample.
Develop a general strategy to determine the number of records needed
to append.
