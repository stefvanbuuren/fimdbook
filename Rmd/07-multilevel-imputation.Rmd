## Introduction {#sec:multi_intro}

Multiple imputation of multilevel data is one of the hot spots in
statistical technology. Imputers and analysts now have a bewildering
array of options for imputing missing values in multilevel data. This
chapter summarizes the state of the art, and formulates advice and
guidelines for practical application of multilevel imputation.

The structure of this chapter is as follows. We start with a concise
overview of three ways to formulate the multilevel model. Section
\@ref(sec:missmult) reviews several non-imputation approaches for
dealing with missing values in multilevel data. Sections
\@ref(sec:mljoint) and \@ref(sec:mlfcs) describe imputation using the
joint modeling and fully conditional specification frameworks.
Sections \@ref(sec:multioutcome) and \@ref(sec:catoutcome) review
current procedures for imputation under multilevel models with
continuous and discrete outcomes, respectively. Section
\@ref(sec:level2pred) deals with missing data in the level-2
predictors, and Section \@ref(sec:comparative) summarizes comparative
work on the different approaches. Section \@ref(sec:mlguidelines)
contains worked examples that illustrate how imputations can be
generated in `mice`, provides guidelines on the practical application,
written in the form of recipes for multilevel imputation. The chapter
closes with an overview of unresolved issues and topics for further
research.

## Notation for multilevel models {#sec:threeformulations}

Multilevel data have a hierarchical, or clustered, structure. The
archetypical example is data from pupils who are nested within classes.
Some of the data may relate to pupils (e.g., test scores), whereas other
data concern the class level (e.g., class size). Another example arises
in longitudinal studies, where the individual’s responses over time are
nested within individuals. Some of the data vary with time (e.g.,
disease history), whereas other data vary between individuals (e.g.,
sex). The term *multilevel analysis* refers to the methodology to
analyze data with such multilevel structure, a methodology that can be
traced back to the definition of the intra-class correlation (ICC) by
@FISHER1925. Multilevel analysis is quite different from methods for
single-level data. The analysis of multilevel data is a vast topic, and
this is not the place to cover the model in detail. There are excellent
introductions by @RAUDENBUSH2002, @GELMAN2007, @SNIJDERS2012,
@FITZMAURICE2011, and @HOX2018. This chapter assumes basic familiarity
with these models.

A challenging aspect of multilevel analysis is the existence of a
variety of notational systems and concepts. This section describes
three different notations. In order to illustrate these notations, we
use data on school performance of grade 8 pupils in Dutch schools.
These data were collected by @BRANDSMA1989, and were used as the
primary examples in Chapters 4 and 5 of @SNIJDERS2012. The data are
available as the `brandsma` object in the `mice` package. The data
contain a mix of both pupil-level measurements and school-level
measurements.

```{r mla.data0}
```

Let us concentrate on four variables, each representing a different role
in the multilevel model:

-   School number, cluster variable;

-   Language test post, outcome at pupil level;

-   Sex of pupil, predictor at pupil level;

-   School denomination, predictor at school level.

The scientific interest is to create a model for predicting the
outcome `lpo` from the level-1 predictor `sex` (coded as 0-1) and the
level-2 predictor `den` (which takes values 1-4). Let the data be
divided into $C$ clusters (e.g., classes, schools), indexed by $c$
($c=1,\dots,C$). Each cluster holds $n_c$ units, indexed by
$i=1,\dots,n_c$. There are three ways to write the same model
[@SCOTT2013A].

In *level notation*, introduced by @BRYK1992, we formulate a multilevel
model as a system of two equations, one at level-1, and two at level-2:

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic}(\#eq:level1)\\
\beta_{0c}     & = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + u_{0c}(\#eq:level2a)\\
\beta_{1c}     & = \gamma_{10}(\#eq:level2b)
\end{align}

where ${{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic}$ is the test score of pupil $i$ in school
$c$, where ${{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic}$ is the sex of pupil $i$ in school
$c$, and where ${{\texttt{den}}}_c$ is the religious denomination of
school $c$. Note that here the subscripts distinguish the level-1 and
level-2 variables. In this notation, ${{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic}$ only
appears in the level-1 model \@ref(eq:level1), and ${{\texttt{den}}}_c$
only appears in the level-2 model \@ref(eq:level2a). The term $\beta_{0c}$
is a random intercept that varies by cluster, while $\beta_{1c}$ is a
sex effect that is assumed to be the same across schools. The term
$\epsilon_{ic}$ is the within-cluster random residual at the pupil level
with a normal distribution
$\epsilon_{ic} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\epsilon}^2)$. The first level-2 model
describes the variation in the mean test score between schools as a
function of the grand mean $\gamma_{00}$, a school-level effect
$\gamma_{01}$ of denomination and a school-level random residual with a
normal distribution $u_{0c} \sim N(0, \sigma_{u_0}^2)$. The second
level-2 model does not have a random residual, so this specifies that
$\beta_{1c}$ is a fixed effect equal in value to $\gamma_{10}$. The
unknowns to be estimated are the fixed parameters $\gamma_{00}$,
$\gamma_{01}$ and $\gamma_{10}$, and the variance components
$\sigma_{\epsilon}^2$ and $\sigma_{u_0}^2$.

We may write the same model as a single predictive equation by
substituting the level-2 models into the level-2 model:

$$
(\#eq:composite1)
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \gamma_{01}{{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + u_{0c} + \epsilon_{ic},
$$

We do not need the double subscripts any more, so we write the model in
*composite notation* as

$$
(\#eq:composite2)
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = \beta_0 + \beta_1{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \beta_2{{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + u_{0c} + \epsilon_{ic},
$$

Note that these $\beta$’s are fixed effects and the $\beta$’s in the
level-1 model \@ref(eq:level1) are random effects. They differ by the
number of subscripts.

The same model written in *matrix notation* is widely known as the
*linear mixed effects model* [@LAIRD1982] and can be written as

$$
y_c = X_c\beta + Z_cu_c + \epsilon_c  (\#eq:lmm)
$$ 

where $y_c = {{\texttt{lpo}}}_c$ is a column vector containing the
scores in cluster $c$, where 
$X_c = ({{\texttt{1}}}, {{\texttt{den}}}_c, {{\texttt{sex}}}_c)$ 
is the $n_c \times 3$ design
matrix in class $c$ associated with the fixed effects, and where $Z_c
= ({{\texttt{1}}})$ is a column with $n_c$ 1’s associated with the
random intercept $u_{0c}$. In the general model, $u_c$ has length $q$
and consists of both random intercepts and random slopes, which are
normally distributed as $u_c \sim N(0,\Omega)$. The $q$ random effects
are typically a subset of the $p$ fixed effects, so $q \leq p$.

The different formulations of the multilevel model reflect different
scientific traditions. The matrix model formulation is favoured among
statisticians because all multilevel models can be economically
expressed by Equation \@ref(eq:lmm), which eases estimation of parameters,
statistical inference and prediction. The books by @MCCULLOCH2001,
@VERBEKE2000, @DELEEUW2008A and @FITZMAURICE2011 are representative for
this tradition. The level formulation clearly separates the roles of
level-1 and level-2 variables, which eases interpretation of the model.
Also, the error structure in each equation is simpler than in the two
other formulations. The level formulation was popularized by @BRYK1992,
and is common in the social sciences. The composite formulation covers
the middle ground. It gives a balance between compactness and clarity,
and is used by the introductions into multilevel analysis for applied
researchers by @SNIJDERS2012 and @HOX2018. @GELMAN2007 provide a
Bayesian approach to multilevel analysis using a related though slightly
different terminology. See @FITZMAURICE2011 [pp. 203-208, Ch. 22] and
@SCOTT2013A for more detail on the relations between the terminologies.

Although the models are mathematically equivalent, the notation has
implications on the ease with which imputation models can be specified.
Equation \@ref(eq:lmm) nicely separates the fixed $X_c$ from random effects
$Z_c$, but the same covariates may appear in both $X_c$ and $Z_c$. This
complicates imputation of those covariates in an FCS framework because
the same variable appears two times in the model. We surely want to
prevent the scenario where imputed versions of the same covariate would
become different in $X_c$ and $Z_c$. The level formulation distinguishes
level-1 variables from level-2 predictors. No overlap occurs between the
sets of variables, so level formulation is natural for developing
imputation procedures for variables at different levels. Likewise, the
composite notation makes it easier to see how the imputation models must
be set up in FCS, and is natural for studying the effect of
interactions.

## Missing values in multilevel data {#sec:missmult}

In single-level data, missing values may occur in the outcome, in the
predictors, or in both. The situation for multilevel data is more
complex. Missing values in the measured variables of the multilevel
model can occur in

1.  the outcome variable;

2.  the level-1 predictors;

3.  the level-2 predictors;

4.  the class variable.

This chapter assumes that the class variable is always completely
observed. In real life, this may not be the case and techniques detailed
in Chapter \@ref(ch:univariate) can be used to impute class membership. See
@HILL1998 and @GOLDSTEIN2011B for models to handle missing class
identification.

### Practical issues in multilevel imputation

In single-level models, the impact of the missing values on the analysis
depends on where in the model they occur. This is also the case in
multilevel analysis. In fact, the multilevel model is very well equipped
to handle missing values in the outcomes. Missing values in the
predictors are generally more difficult to handle. Some children may
have missing values for the age of the child, occupational status of the
father, ethnic background, and so on. In longitudinal applications,
missing data may occur in time-varying covariates, like nutritional
status and stage of pubertal development. Most mixed methods cannot
handle such missing values, and will remove children with any missing
values in the level-1 predictors prior to analysis.

Missing data in the level-2 predictors occur if, for example, it is not
known whether a school is public or private. In a longitudinal setting,
missing data in fixed person characteristics, like sex or education,
lead to incomplete level-2 predictors. The consequences of such missing
values can be even larger. The typical fix is to delete all records in
the class. For example, suppose that the model contains the professional
qualification of the teacher. If the qualification is missing, the data
of all pupils in the class are disregarded.

Many multilevel models define *derived variables* as part of the
analysis, like the cluster means of a level-1 predictor, the product of
two level-1 predictors, the dummy-coded version of a categorical
variable, the disaggregated version of a level-2 predictor, and so on.
We can calculate such derived variables from the data and include them
into the model as needed, but of course this is only possible when data
are complete. Although the derived variables themselves need not be
imputed (because we can always recalculate them from the imputed data),
the imputation model needs to be aware of, and account for, the role
that such derived variables play in the complete-data model.

In practice, complications may arise due to the nature of the data or
model. Some of these are as follows:

1.  For *small clusters* the within-cluster mean and variance are
    unreliable estimates, so the choice of the prior distribution
    becomes critical.

2.  For a *small number of clusters*, it is difficult to estimate the
    between-cluster variance of the random effects.

3.  In applications with *systematically missing data*, there are no
    observed values in the cluster, so the cluster location cannot
    be estimated.

4.  The variation of the random slopes can be large, so the method used
    to deal with the missing data should account for this.

5.  The error variance $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ may differ across clusters
    (*heteroscedasticity*)

6.  The *residual error distributions* can be far from normal.

7.  The model contains aggregates of the level-1 variables, such as
    cluster means, which need to be taken in account during imputation.

8.  The model contains interactions, or other nonlinear terms.

9.  The multilevel model may be very complex, it may not be possible to
    fit the model, or there are convergence problems.

  1.   Will the complete-data model include random slopes?
  2.   Will the data contain systematically missing values?
  3.   Will the distribution of the residuals be non-normal?
  4.   Will the error variance differ over clusters?
  5.   Will there be small clusters?
  6.   Will there be a small number of clusters?
  7.   Will the complete-data model have cross-level interactions?
  8.   Will the dataset be very large?

: (\#tab:mlquestions) Questions to gauge the complexity of a 
  multilevel imputation task.

There is not one super-method that will address all such issues. In
practice, we may need to emphasize certain issues at the expense of
others. In order to gauge the complexity of the imputation task for
particular dataset and model, ask yourself the questions listed in Table
\@ref(tab:mlquestions). If your answer to all questions is “NO”, then there
are several methods for multilevel MI that are available in standard
software. If many of your answers are “YES”, the situation is less
clear-cut, and you may need to think about the relative priority of the
questions in light of the needs for the application.

### Ad-hoc solutions for multilevel data

Missing values in the level-1 predictors or the level-2 predictors have
long been treated by listwise deletion. This is easy to do, but may have
severe adverse effects, especially for missing values in level-2
predictors. For example, we may not know whether a school is public or
private. Ignoring all records pertaining to that school is not only
wasteful, but may also lead to selection effects at cluster level. While
listwise deletion could be useful when the variance of the slopes is
large, it is not generally recommended [@GRUND2016].

Another ad-hoc solution is to ignore the clustering and impute the data
by a single-level method. It is known that this will underestimate the
intra-class correlation [@TALJAARD2008; @VANBUUREN2011; @ENDERS2016].
@LUDTKE2017 derived an expression for the asymptotic bias for the
intra-class correlation under the random intercept model. The amount of
underestimation grows with the ICC and with the missing data rate.
Increasing the cluster size hardly aids in reducing this bias. In
addition, the regression weights for the fixed effects will be biased.
@GRUND2018 conclude that single-level imputation should be avoided
unless only a few cases contain missing data (e.g., less than 5%) and
the intra-class correlation is low (e.g., less than .10). Conducting
multiple imputation with the wrong model (e.g., single-level methods)
can be more hazardous than listwise deletion.

Another ad-hoc technique is to add a dummy variable for each cluster, so
that the model estimates a separate coefficient for each cluster. The
coefficients are estimated by ordinary least squares, and the parameters
are drawn from their posteriors. If the missing values are restricted to
the outcome, this method will estimate the fixed effects quite well, but
also artificially inflates the true variation between groups, and thus
biases the ICC upwards [@ANDRIDGE2011; @VANBUUREN2011; @GRAHAM2012]. If
there are also missing values in the predictors, the level-1 regression
weights will be unbiased, but the level-2 weights are biased, in
particular for small clusters and low ICC. See @LUDTKE2017 for more
detail, who also derive the asymptotic bias. If the primary interest is
on the fixed effects, adding a cluster dummy is an easily implementable
alternative, unless the missing rate is very large and/or the
intra-class correlation is very low and the number of records in the
cluster is small [@DRESCHLER2015; @LUDTKE2017]. Since the bias in random
slopes and variance components can be substantial, one should turn to
multilevel imputation to obtain proper estimates of those parts of the
multilevel model [@SPEIDEL2017].

@VINK2015 described an application of Australian school data with
over 2.8 million records, where a dummy variable per school was
combined with predictive mean matching. Given the size and complexity
of the imputation problem, this application would have been
computationally infeasible with full multilevel imputation. Thus, for
large databases, adding a dummy variable per cluster is a practical
and useful technique for estimating the fixed effects.

### Likelihood solutions

The multilevel model is actually “made to solve” the problem of missing
values in the outcome. There is an extensive literature, especially for
longitudinal data [@VERBEKE2000; @MOLENBERGHS2005; @DANIELS2008]. For
more details, see the encyclopaedic overview in @FITZMAURICE2009.
Multilevel models have the ability to handle models with varying time
points, which is an advance over traditional repeated-measures ANOVA,
where the usual treatment is to remove the entire case if one of the
outcomes is missing. Multilevel models do not assume an equal number of
occasions or fixed time points, so all cases can be used for analysis.

Missing outcome data are easily handled in modern likelihood-based
methods. @SNIJDERS2012 [p. 56] write that the model “can even be applied
if some groups have sample size 1, as long as other groups have greater
sizes.” Of course, this statement will only go as far as the assumptions
of the model are met: the data are missing at random and the model is
correctly specified.

Mixed-effects models can be fit with maximum-likelihood methods, which
take care of missing data in the dependent variable. This principle
can be extended to address missing data in explanatory variables in
(multilevel) software for structural equation modeling like *Mplus*
[@MUTHEN2016] and `gllamm` [@RABE2002]. @GRUND2018 remarked that such
extensions could alter the meaning and value of the parameters of
interest.

## Multilevel imputation by joint modeling {#sec:mljoint}

The joint model specifies a single model for all incomplete variables in
data. Suppose that we have missing values in both outcome $y_c$ and the
level-1 predictors $X_c$ in the linear mixed model \@ref(eq:lmm) with
random intercepts. A limitation of the standard model is that both $X_c$
and $Z_c$ need to be completely observed. @SCHAFER2002A showed that it
is possible to reformulate the model by placing all variables in the
model as an outcome on the left-hand side of model \@ref(eq:lmm), which
gives rise to multilevel models with multivariate outcomes. Suppose that
$Y_{ic}$ is the $1 \times p$ matrix of all incomplete variables from
unit $i$ in class $c$. Under a random intercept model, the multivariate
multilevel model decomposes the data into a between-group part and a
within-group part as 

$$
Y_{ic} = \mu + Y_c^\mathrm{between} + Y_{ic}^\mathrm{within}. (\#eq:jmdecomp)
$$

The relations between the $p$ variables at the group level are
captured by the between component $Y_c^\mathrm{between}$, while
relations at the individual level are captured by
$Y_{ic}^\mathrm{within}$. @LUDTKE2017 explain how this decomposition
can be applied to draw imputations for the missing elements in $Y_c$.

The approach has been implemented in the `pan` package [@ZHAO2016].
and @YUCEL2011 discussed extensions for categorical data using the
generalized linear mixed model. @GOLDSTEIN2009 described a joint model
for mixed continuous-categorical data with a multilevel structure.
@CARPENTER2013 and @GOLDSTEIN2014 proposed extensions for ordinal
and unordered categorical data, which are implemented in the
`REALCOM-IMPUTE` software [@CARPENTER2011]. @QUARTAGNO2016 extended
this work by allowing for heteroscedasticity of the imputation model,
combined with imputation of binary (and more generally categorical)
variables, which is available through the `jomo` package
[@QUARTAGNO2017]. Related work has been done by @ASPAROUHOV2010 
for M*plus*.

Because of the decomposition \@ref(eq:jmdecomp), imputation by joint
modeling is very natural when the complete-data analysis focuses on
different within- and between-cluster associations [@ENDERS2016;
@GRUND2016]. Multilevel imputation is not without problems. Except for
`jomo`, most models assume a homoscedastic error structure in the
level-1 residuals, which implies no random slope variation between
$Y_{ic}$ [@CARPENTER2013; @ENDERS2016]. Imputations created by `jomo`
reflect pairwise linear relationships in the data and ignore
higher-orders interaction and non-linearities. Joint modeling may also
experience difficulties with smaller samples and the default inverse
Wishart prior [@GRUND2018; @AUDIGIER2018].

Imputation models can also be formulated as latent class models
[@VERMUNT2008; @VIDOTTO2015]. proposed a Bayesian multilevel latent
class model that is designed to capture heterogeneity in the data at
both levels through local independence and conditional independence
assumptions. This class of models is quite flexible. As the method is
very recent, there is not yet much practical experience.

## Multilevel imputation by fully conditional specification {#sec:mlfcs}

Another possibility is to iterate univariate multilevel imputation
over the variables [@VANBUUREN2011]. For example, suppose there are
missing values in `lpo` and `sex` in model \@ref(eq:composite2). One
way to draw imputations is to alternate the following two steps:

\begin{align}
\dot{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 {{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + \beta_2 {{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + u_{0c}, \sigma_\epsilon^2)(\#eq:naivefcs)\\
\dot{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} & \sim N(\beta_0 + \beta_1 {{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + \beta_2 {{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} + u_{0c}, \sigma_\epsilon^2)(\#eq:naivefcs2)
\end{align}

where all parameters are re-estimated at every iteration. Since the
first equation corresponds to the complete-data model, there are no
issues with this step. The second equation simply alternates the roles
of `lpo` and `sex`, and uses the inverted mixed model to draw
imputations. The above steps illustrate the key idea of multilevel
imputation using FCS. It is not yet clear when and how the idea will
work.

@RESCHE2016 studied the consequences of model inversion, and found
that the conditional expectation of the level-1 predictor in a
multivariate multilevel model with random intercepts depends on the
cluster mean of the predictor, and on the size of the cluster. In
addition, the conditional variance depends on cluster size. These
results hold for the random intercept model. Of course, including
random slopes as well will only complicate matters. The naive FCS
procedure in Equation \@ref(eq:naivefcs) does not account for the
cluster means or for the effects of cluster size, and hence might not
provide good imputations. From their derivation, @RESCHE2016 therefore
hypothesized that the imputation model (1) should incorporate the
cluster means, and (2) be heteroscedastic if cluster sizes vary. We
now discuss these points in turn.

### Add cluster means of predictors {#sec:clustermeans}

Simulations done by @RESCHE2016 showed little impact of adding the
cluster means of the level-1 predictors to the imputation model, but
did not hurt either. However, several other studies found substantial
impact. described how the inclusion of cluster means preserves
contextual effects. Adding a group mean of level-1 variables allows us
to estimate the difference between within-group and between-group
regressions. The aggregates are generally called contextual variables.
Including both the individual and contextual variables into the same
model is useful to find out whether the contextual variable would
improve prediction of the outcome after the differences at the
individual level have been taken into account. proposed to add
contextual variables more generally to univariate multilevel
imputation, requiring a change in the algorithm. In particular,
cluster means need to be dynamically calculated from the currently
imputed predictors, and depending on the model the original predictor
needs to be replaced by its group-centered version, as in @KREFT1995.
In random slope models, the two specifications have different
meanings, so the decision as to whether or not to use group-mean
centered predictors at level 1 should be made in accordance with the
analysis model. In random intercept models, the two specifications are
equivalent and can be transformed into one another, so imputations
should yield equivalent results regardless of centering. @MISTLER2017
present a thorough and detailed analysis on the effects of this
adaptation, both for a joint model and for an FCS model. Their paper
demonstrated that in both cases, inclusion of the means of the
clusters markedly improved performance. present an extensive
simulation study contrasting many state-of-the-art imputation
techniques. In all scenarios involving multilevel FCS, including the
cluster means in the imputation model was beneficial.

The difference between the results of @RESCHE2016 on the one hand, and
the other three studies is likely to be caused by a difference in
complete-data models. The latter three studies used a contextual
analysis model, which includes the cluster means into the substantive
model, whereas @RESCHE2016 were not interested in fitting such a
model. Hence, it appears that these studies address separate issues.
@RESCHE2016 are interested in improving *compatibility* among the
conditional models without reference to a particular analysis model.
Their result indicates that trying to improve compatibility of
conditionals seems to have little effect, a result that is in line
with the existing literature on FCS. The other three studies address
the problem of *congeniality*, a mismatch between the imputation model
and the substantive model. Improving congeniality had a major effect,
which is in line with the larger multiple imputation literature.
Section \@ref(sec:congeniality) explains the confusion surrounding the
term compatibility in some detail.

A problematic aspect of including cluster means is that the contextual
variable may be an unreliable estimate in small clusters. It is known
that the regression weight of the contextual variable is then biased
[@LUDTKE2008]. A solution is to formulate the contextual variable as a
latent variable, and use an estimator that essentially shrinks the
weight towards zero. Most joint modeling approaches assume a
multivariate mixed-effects model, where cluster means are latent.

It is not yet clear when the manifest cluster means can be regarded as
“correct” in an FCS context. When clusters are large and of similar
size, the manifest cluster means are likely to be valid and have little
differential shrinkage. For smaller clusters or clusters of unequal
size, including the cluster means in the imputation model also seems
valid because proper imputation techniques will use draws from the
posterior distribution of the group means rather than using the manifest
means themselves. All in all, it appears preferable to include the
cluster means into the imputation model.

### Model cluster heterogeneity {#sec:hetero}

@VANBUUREN2011 considered the homoscedastic linear mixed model as
invalid for imputing incomplete predictors, and investigated only the
`2l.norm` method, which allows for heterogeneous error variances by
employing an intricate Gibbs sampler. The `2l.norm` method is not
designed to impute variables that are systematically missing for all
cases in the cluster. @RESCHE2016 developed a solution for this case
using a heteroscedastic two-stage method, which also generalizes to
binary and count data. compared several univariate multilevel
imputation methods, and concluded that “heteroscedastic imputation
methods perform better than homoscedastic methods, which should be
reserved with few individuals only.” Apart from the last paper there
is relatively little evidence on the benefits of allowing for
heteroscedasticity. It could be very well that heteroscedasticity is a
useful option to improve compatibility of the conditionals, but the
last word has not yet been said.

## Continuous outcome {#sec:multioutcome}

This section discusses the problem of how to create multiple
imputations under the multilevel model when missing values occur in
the outcome $y_{c}$ only.

### General principle

Imputations under the linear mixed model in Equation \@ref(eq:lmm) can
be generated by taking draws from posterior distribution of the
modeled parameters, followed by a step to draw the imputations. The
sequence of steps is:

1.  Fit model \@ref(eq:lmm) to the observed data to obtain estimates
    $\hat\sigma^2$, $\hat\beta$, $\hat\Omega$ and $\hat u_c$;

2.  Generate random draws $\dot\sigma^2$, $\dot\beta$, $\dot\Omega$ and
    $\dot u_c$ from their posteriors;

3.  For each missing value, calculate its expected value under the drawn
    model, and add a randomly drawn error to it.

These steps form a template for any multilevel imputation method. For
step 1 we may use standard multilevel software. Step 2 is needed to
properly account for the uncertainty of the model, and this generally
requires custom software that generates the draws. Alternatively, we
may use bootstrapping to incorporate model uncertainty, although this
is more complex than usual since resampling is needed at two levels
[@GOLDSTEIN2011]. Once we have obtained the parameter draws,
generating the imputation is straightforward. It is also possible to
use predictive mean matching in step 3.

We illustrate these steps by the method proposed by @JOLANI2017 for
imputing mixes of systematically and sporadically missing values. Step
1 of that method consists of calling the `lmer()` from the `lme4`
package to fit the model. Step 2 draws successively $\dot\sigma^2$,
$\dot\beta$, $\dot\Omega$ under a normal-inverse-Wishart prior for
$\Omega$, and $\dot u_c$ from the conditional normal model for
sporadically missing data, and from an unconditional normal model for
systematically missing values. See the paper for the exact
specification of these steps. The expected value of the missing entry
is then calculated, and a random draw from the residual error
distribution is added to create the imputation. These steps are
implemented as the `2l.lmer` method in `mice`.

Predictive mean matching works well for single-level continuous data,
and is also an interesting option for imputing multilevel data. The
idea is to calculate predicted values under the linear mixed model for
all level-1 units. Level-1 units with observed outcomes are selected
as potential donors depending on the distance in the predictive
metric. It is up to the imputer to specify whether or not donors
should be restricted to inherit from the same cluster. Drawing values
inside the cluster may preserve heteroscedasticity better than taking
donors from all clusters, which should strengthen the homoscedasticity
assumption. So if preserving such heterogeneity is important, draws
should be made locally. Intuitively, drawing from one’s own cluster
should be done only if the cluster is relatively large, so that the
procedure can find enough good matches. If different clusters come
from different reporting systems, i.e., using centimeters and
converted inches, the imputer might wish to preserve such features by
restricting draws to the local cluster. If clusters are geographically
ordered, then one may try to preserve unmeasured local features by
restricting donors to the neighboring clusters. @VINK2015 presents an
application that exploits this feature.

### Methods

The `mice`, `miceadds`, `micemd` and `mitml` packages contain useful
functions for multilevel imputation. The `mice` package implements two
methods, `2l.lmer` and `2l.pan`. Method `2l.lmer` [@JOLANI2017]
imputes both sporadically and systematically missing values. Under the
appropriate model, the method is randomization-valid for the fixed
effects, but the variance components were more difficult to estimate,
especially for a small number of clusters. Method `2l.pan` uses the
PAN method [@SCHAFER2002A]. Method `2l.continuous` from `miceadds` is
similar to `2l.lmer` with some different options. The `2l.jomo` method
from `micemd` is similar to `2l.pan`, but uses the `jomo` package as
the computational engine. Method `2l.glm.norm` is similar to
`2l.continuous` and `2l.lmer`.

Two functions for heteroscedastic errors are available. A method named
`2l.2stage.norm` from `micemd` implements the two-stage method by
@RESCHE2016. The `2l.norm` method from `mice` implements the Gibbs
sampler from @KASIM1998. Method `2l.norm` can recover the
intra-class correlation quite well, even for severe MAR cases and high
amounts of missing data in the outcome or the predictor. However, it
is fairly slow and fails to achieve nominal coverage for the fixed
effects for small classes [@VANBUUREN2011].

The `2l.pmm` method in the `miceadds` package is a generalization of
the default `pmm` method to data with two levels using linear mixed
model fitted by `lmer` or `blmer` models. Method `2l.2stage.pmm`
generalizes `pmm` by a two-stage method. The default in both methods
is to obtain donors across all clusters, which is probably fine for
most applications.

Table \@ref(tab:mlacontinuous) presents an overview of `R` functions
for univariate imputations according to a multilevel model for
continuous outcomes. Each row represents a function. The functions
belong to different packages, and there is overlap in functionality.
All functions can be called from `mice()` as building blocks to form
an iterative FCS algorithm.

### Example {#sec:contexam}

We use the `brandsma` data introduced in Section
\@ref(sec:threeformulations). Here we will analyze the full set of
4016 pupils. Apart from Chapter 9, @SNIJDERS2012 concentrated on the
analysis of a reduced set of 3758 pupils. In order to keep things
simple, this section restricts the analysis to just two variables.

```{r mla.data1}
```

The cluster variable is `sch`. The variable `lpo` is the pupil’s test
score at grade 8. The cluster variable is complete, but `lpo` has 204
missing values.

```{r mla.data2}
```

How do we impute the 204 missing values? Let’s apply the following five
methods:

1. `sample`: Find imputations by random sampling from the observed
   values in `lpo`. This method ignores `sch`;

2. `pmm`: Single-level predictive mean matching with the school 
   indicator coded as a dummy variable;

3. `2l.pan`: Multilevel method using the linear mixed model to draw 
   univariate imputations;

4. `2l.norm`: Multilevel method using the linear mixed model with 
   heterogeneous error variances;

5. `2l.pmm`: Predictive mean matching based on predictions from the 
   linear mixed model, with random draws from the regression 
   coefficients and the random effects, using five donors.

The following code block will impute the data according to these five
methods.

```{r mla.empty1, cache = TRUE}
```

The code `-2` in the predictor matrix `pred` signals that `sch` is the
cluster variable. There is only one variable with missing values here,
so we do not need to iterate, and can set `maxit = 1`. The `miceadds`
library is needed for the `2l.pmm` method.

```{r mlsd,  solo = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = '(ref:mlsd)'}
```

(ref:mlsd) Distribution of standard deviations of language score per
school.

The `2l.pan` and `2l.norm` methods are the oldest multilevel methods.
Method `2l.pan` is very fast, while method `2l.norm` is more flexible
since the within-cluster error variances may differ. To see which of
these methods should be preferred for these data, let us study the
distribution of the standard deviation of `lpo` by schools. Figure
\@ref(fig:mlsd) shows that the standard deviation per school varies
between 4 and 16, a fairly large spread. This suggests that `2l.norm`
might be preferred here.

```{r mldist, echo = FALSE, solo = TRUE, fig.asp = 1.25, fig.cap = '(ref:mldist)'}
```

(ref:mldist) Box plots comparing the distribution of the observed data
(blue), and the imputed data (red) under five methods, split according
to the number of missing values per school.

Figure \@ref(fig:mldist) shows the box plot of the observed data (in blue)
and the imputed data (in red) under each of the methods. Box plots are
drawn for school with zero missing values, one missing value, two or
three missing values and more than three missing values. Pupils in
schools with one to three missing values have lower scores than pupils
from a school with complete data. Pupils from schools with more than
three missing values score similar to pupils from schools with complete
data. It is interesting to study how well the different imputation
methods preserve this feature in the data.

Method `sample` does not use any school information, and hence the
imputations in all schools look alike. Methods `pmm`, `2l.pan`,
`2l.norm` and `2l.pmm` preserve the pattern, though the differences
are less outspoken than in the observed data. Note that the
distribution of the two normal methods (`2l.pan` and `2l.norm`) have
tails that extend beyond the range of the observed data (the maximum
is 58). Hence, complete-data estimators based on the tails (e.g.,
finding the Top 10 Dutch schools) can be distorted by this use of the
normal imputation.

```{r mldens, echo = FALSE, solo = TRUE, fig.asp = 1, fig.cap = '(ref:mldens)'}
```

(ref:mldens) Density plots for schools with one and with two or three
missing values for `2l.pan` (top) and `2l.pmm` (bottom).

Figure \@ref(fig:mldens) shows the density plot of the 10 sets of
imputed values (red) compared with the density plot of the observed
values (blue). The top row corresponds to the `2l.pan` method, and
shows that some parts of the blue curve are not well represented by
the imputed values. The method at the bottom row (`2l.pmm`) tracks the
observed data distribution a little better.

Most research to date has concentrated on multilevel imputation using
the normal model. In reality, normality is always an approximation, and
it depends on the substantive question of how good this approximation
should be. Two-level predictive mean matching is a promising alternative
that can impute close to the data.

## Discrete outcome {#sec:catoutcome}

This section details how to create multiple imputations under the
multilevel model when missing values occur in a discrete outcome only.

### Methods

The generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) extends the mixed model for
continuous data with link functions. For example, we can draw
imputations for clustered binary data by positing a logit link with a
binomial distribution. As before, all parameters need to be drawn from
their respective posteriors in order to account for the sampling
variation.

@JOLANI2015 developed a multilevel imputation method for binary data
obtaining estimates of the parameters of model by the `lme4::glmer()`
function in `lme4` package [@BATES2015], followed by a sequence of
random draws from the parameter distributions. For meta-analysis of
individual participant data, this method outperforms simpler methods
that ignore the clustering, that assume MCAR or that split the data by
cluster [@JOLANI2015]. The method is available as method `2l.bin` in
`mice`. The `miceadds` package @MICEADDS contains a method `2l.binary`
that allows the user to choose between likelihood estimation with
`lme4::glmer()` and penalized ML with `blme::bglmer()` [@CHUNG2013].
Related methods are available under sequential hierarchical regression
imputation (SHRIMP) framework [@YUCEL2017].

@RESCHE2016 proposed a two-stage estimator. At step 1, a linear
regression model is fitted to each observed cluster. Any sporadically
missing data are imputed, and the model per cluster ignores any
systematically missing variables. At step 2, estimates obtained from
each cluster are combined using meta-analysis. Systematically missing
variables are modeled through a linear random effect model across
clusters. A method for binary data is available as the method
`2l.2stage.bin` in the `micemd` package. The two-stage estimator is
related to work done by @GELMAN1998 on data combinations of different
surveys. These authors fitted a separate imputation for each survey
using only the questions posed in the survey, and used hierarchical
meta-analysis to combine the results from different surveys. Their
term “not asked” translates into “systematically missing”, whereas
“not answered” translates into “sporadically missing”.

Missing level-1 count outcomes can be imputed under the generalized
linear mixed model using a Poisson or (zero-inflated) negative
binomial distributions [@KLEINKE2015]. Relevant functions can be found
in the `micemd` and `countimp` packages. Table \@ref(tab:mlacat)
presents an overview of `R` functions for univariate imputations for
discrete outcomes. Discrete data can also be imputed by the predictive
mean matching functions listed in Table \@ref(tab:mlacontinuous).

### Example {#example}

The `toenail` data were collected in a randomized parallel group trial
comparing two treatments for a common toenail infection. A total of
294 patients were seen at seven visits, and severity of infection was
dichotomized as “not severe” (0) and “severe” (1). The version of the
data in the `mice` is all numeric and easy to analyze. The
following statements load the data, and expand the data to the full
design with $7 \times 294 = 2058$ rows. There are in total 150 missed
visits.

```{r toenail.2l.3, cache = TRUE}
```

@MOLENBERGHS2005 described various analyses of these data. Here we
impute the outcome of the missed visits. The next code block declares
`ID` as the cluster variable, and creates $m=5$ imputations for the
missing outcomes by method `2l.bin`.

```{r toenail.2l.4, cache = TRUE}
```

```{r toenailprofiles, echo = FALSE, solo = TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:toenailprofiles)'}
```

(ref:toenailprofiles) Plot of observed (blue) and imputed (red)
infection (Yes/No) by visit for 16 selected persons in the toenail
data ($m = 5$). The lines visualize the subject-wise infection
probability predicted by the generalized linear mixed model given
visit, treatment and their interaction per imputed dataset.

Figure \@ref(fig:toenailprofiles) visualizes the imputations. The
plot shows the partially imputed profiles of 16 subjects in the
`toenail` data. The general downward trend in the probability of
infection severity with time is obvious, and was also found by
@MOLENBERGHS2005 [p. 302]. Subjects 9 (never severe) and 117 (always
severe) have both complete data. They represent the extremes, and
their random effect estimates are very similar in all five imputed
datasets. They are close, but not identical -- as you might have
expected -- because the multiple imputations will affect the random
effects also for the fully observed subjects. Subjects 31, 41 and 309
are imputed such that their outcomes are equivalent to subject 9, and
hence have similar random effect estimates. In contrast, subject 214
has the same observed data pattern as 31, but it is sometimes imputed
as “severe”. As a consequence, we see that there are now two random
effect estimates for this subject that are quite different, which
reflects the uncertainty due to the missing data. Subjects 48 and 99
even have three clearly different estimates. Imputation number 3 is
colored green instead of grey, so the isolated lines in subjects 48
and 230 come from the same imputed dataset.

The complete-data model is a generalized linear mixed model for
outcome given treatment status, time and a random intercept. This is
similar to the models used by @MOLENBERGHS2005, but here we use the
visit instead of time (which is incomplete) as the timing variable.
The estimates from the combined multiple imputation analysis are then
obtained as

```{r toenail.est, cache=TRUE}
```

As expected, these estimates are similar to the estimates obtained
from the direct analysis of these data. The added value of multiple
imputation here is that it produces a dataset with scores on all
visits, which makes it easier to summarize. The added values of
imputation increases if important covariates are available that are
not present in the substantive model, or if missing values occur in
the predictors. Section \@ref(sec:ri1pred) contains an example of that
problem.

## Imputation of level-2 variable {#sec:level2pred}

The typical fix for missing values in a level-2 predictor is to delete
all records in the cluster. Despite its potential impact on the
analyses, the problem of incomplete level-2 predictors thus far
received less attention than missingness in level-1 predictors.

Some authors studied the use of (inappropriate) single-level
imputation methods that ignore the hierarchical group structure in
multilevel data. Standard errors are underestimated, leading to
confidence intervals that are too short. Early attempts to solve the
problem with multiple imputation [@GIBSON2003; @CHEUNG2007] were not
successful.

Imputation methods for level-2 predictors should assign the same
imputed value to all members within the same class. More recent
attempts create two datasets, one with level-1 data, and one with
level-2 data, and do separate imputations within each dataset while
using the results from one in the other. Of course, these steps can be
iterated [@GELMAN2007; @GRUND2018B].

The `mice` package contains several functions whose names start with
`mice.impute.2lonly`. Method `2lonly.mean` fills in the class mean,
and is primarily useful to repair errors in the data. Methods
`2lonly.norm` and `2lonly.pmm` aggregate level-1 predictors, and
impute the level-2 variables by the normal model and by predictive
mean matching, respectively. The `miceadds` package contains two
generic functions. The method `2lonly.function` allows the user to
specify any univariate imputation function designed for level-1 data
at level-2.

It is conceptually straightforward to extend imputations to higher
levels [@YUCEL2008]. If there are two levels, combine all level-2
predictors with an aggregate (e.g., the cluster means) of the level-1
predictors and the level-1 outcomes. Once we have this, we may choose
suitable methods from Chapter \@ref(ch:univariate) to impute the
missing level-2 variables in the usual way. No new issues arise.

Method `ml.lmer` from `miceadds` implements a generalization to three
or more levels. In addition, it also allows imputation at the lowest
level (and any other level) with an arbitrary specification of
(additive) random effects. This includes general nested models,
cross-classified models, the ability to include cluster means at any
level of clustering, and the specification of random slopes at any
level of clustering. Table \@ref(tab:funcmixed) lists the various
methods.

## Comparative work {#sec:comparative}

Several comparisons on multilevel imputation methods are available.
This section is a short summary of the main findings.

@ENDERS2016 compared JM and FCS multilevel approaches, and found
that both JM and FCS imputation are appropriate for random intercept
analyses. The JM method was found to be superior for analyses that
focus on different within- and between-cluster associations, whereas
FCS provided a dramatic improvement over the JM in random slope
models. Moreover, it turned out that the use of a latent variable for
imputation of categorical variables worked well.

@MISTLER2017 showed that more flexible and modern imputation methods
for JM and FCS are preferable to older methods that assume
homoscedastic distributions or multivariate normality. For random
intercept models, JM and FCS are about equally good. The authors noted
that JM does not preserve random slope variation, whereas FCS does.

@KUNKEL2017 compared JM and FCS for models for random intercepts in
the context of individual patient data. They found that, in spite of
the theoretical differences, FCS and JM produced similar results.
Moreover these authors highlighted that results were sensitive to the
choice of the prior in high missingness scenarios.

@GRUND2018 present a detailed comparison between JM, FCS and FIML
using current implementations. For random intercept models, they found
JM and FCS equally effective, and better than ad-hoc approaches or
FIML. A difference with @ENDERS2016 was the addition of FCS methods
that included cluster means. For models with random slopes and
cross-level interactions, FCS was found almost unbiased for the main
effects, but less reliable for higher-order terms. For categorical
data, the conclusion was that both multilevel JM and FCS are suitable
for creating multiple imputations. Incomplete level-2 variables were
handled equally well by JM, FCS and FIML.

@AUDIGIER2018 found that JM, as implemented in `jomo`, worked well
with large clusters and binary data, but had difficulty in modeling
small (number of) clusters, tending to conservative inferences. The
homogeneity assumption in the standard generalized linear mixed model
was found to be limiting. The two-stage approach was found to perform
well for systematically missing data, but was less reliable for small
clusters.

The picture that emerges is that FIML is not inherently preferable for
missing predictors or outcomes. Modern versions of JM and FCS are
reliable ways of dealing with missing data in multilevel models with
random intercepts. The FCS framework seems better suited to
accommodate models with random slopes, but may have difficulty with
higher-order terms.

## Guidelines and advice {#sec:mlguidelines}

Many new multilevel methods have seen the light in the last five
years. The comparative work as summarized above spawned a wealth of
information. This section provides advice, guidelines and worked
examples aimed to assist the applied statistician in solving practical
multilevel imputation problems. The field moves rapidly, so the
recommendations given here may change as more detailed comparative
works become available in the future.

The advice given here builds upon the recommendations and code
examples given in Table 6 in @GRUND2018, supplemented by some of my
personal biases.

There is not yet a fully satisfactory strategy for handling
interactions with FCS. In this section, I will use passive imputation
[@VANBUUREN2000], a technique that allows the user to specify
deterministic relations between variables, which, amongst others, is
useful for calculating interaction effects within the MICE algorithm.
I will use passive imputation to enrich univariate imputation models
with two-order interactions, in an attempt to preserve higher-order
relations in the data. Passive imputation works reasonably well, and
it is easy to apply in standard software, but it is only an
approximate solution. In general, the joint distribution of the
dependent and explanatory variables tends to become complex when the
substantive model contains interactions [@SEAMAN2012; @KIM2015].

We revisit the `brandsma` data use in Chapters 4 and 5 of
@SNIJDERS2012. For reasons of clarity, the code examples are
restricted to a subset of six variables.

```{r mla.data3}
```

There is one cluster variable (`sch`), one administrative variable
(`pup`), one outcome variable at the pupil level (`lpo`), two
explanatory variables at the pupil level (`iqv`, `ses`) and one
explanatory variable at the school level (`ssi`). The cluster variable
and pupil number are complete, whereas the others contain missing
values.

```{r mdp, echo = FALSE, solo = TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:mdp)'}
```

(ref:mdp) Missing data pattern of subset of `brandsma` data.

Figure \@ref(fig:mdp), with the missing data patterns, reveals
that there are 3183 (out of 4016) pupils without missing values. For
the remaining sample, most have a missing value in just one variable:
583 pupils have only missing `ssi`, 175 pupils have only missing
`lpo`, 104 pupils have only missing `ses` and 11 pupils have only
missing `lpo`. The remaining 50 pupils have two or three missing
values. The challenge is to perform the analyses from @SNIJDERS2012 
using the full set with 4016 pupils.

### Intercept-only model, missing outcomes {#sec:emptymodel}

The intercept-only (or empty) model is the simplest multilevel model.
We have already imputed the data according to this model 
in Section \@ref(sec:contexam). Here we select the imputations 
according to the `2l.pmm` method for further analysis.

```{r mla.empty10, cache = TRUE}
```

The empty model is fitted to the imputed datasets, and the estimates are
pooled as

```{r mla.empty5}
```

We may obtain the variance components by the `testEstimates()`
function from `mitml`:

```{r mla.empty6}
```

See Example 4.1 in @SNIJDERS2012 for the interpretation of the
estimates from this model.

### Random intercepts, missing level-1 predictor {#sec:ri1pred}

Let’s now extend the model in order to quantify the impact of IQ on the
language score. This random intercepts model with one explanatory
variable is defined by

$$
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10} {{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + u_{0c} + \epsilon_{ic}. (\#eq:ril1p)
$$

In level notation, the model reads as

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic} (\#eq:ril1pa)\\
\beta_{0c}     & = \gamma_{00} + u_{0c} (\#eq:ril1pb)\\
\beta_{1c}     & = \gamma_{10} (\#eq:ril1pc)
\end{align}

There are missing data in both `lpo` and `iqv`. Imputation can be done
with both FCS and JM. For FCS my advice is to impute `lpo` and `iqv`
by `2l.pmm` with added cluster means. Adding the cluster means is done
here to improve compatibility among the conditional specified
imputation models (cf. Section \@ref(sec:clustermeans)).

```{r mla.ri1, cache = TRUE}
```

An entry of `-2` in the predictor matrix signals the cluster variable,
whereas an entry of `3` indicates that the cluster means of the
covariates are added as a predictor to the imputation model. Thus,
`lpo` is imputed from `iqv` *and* the cluster means of `iqv`, while
`iqv` is imputed from `lpo` *and* the cluster means of `lpo`. If the
residuals are close to normal and the within-cluster error variances
are similar, then `2l.pan` is also a good choice.

Rescaling the variables as deviations from their mean often helps to
improve stability of the estimates. We may rescale `lpo` to zero-mean
by

```{r mla.ri1b, eval = FALSE}
```

The imputations will also adopt that scale, so we must back-transform
the data if we want to analyze the data in the original scale. For the
multilevel model with only random intercepts and fixed slopes, rescaling
the data to the origin presents no issues since the model is invariant
to linear transformations. This is not true when there are random slopes
[@HOX2018 p. 48]. We return to this point in Section
\@ref(sec:randomslopes).

The JM can create multivariate imputations by the `jomoImpute` or
`panImpute` methods. We use `panImpute` here.

```{r mla.ri2, cache = TRUE}
```

which returns as object of class `mitml`. The `panImpute` method can
also be called from `mice` by creating one block for all variables as

```{r mla.ri3, cache = TRUE}
```

This uses a new facility in `mice` that allows imputation of blocks of
variables (cf. Section \@ref(sec:blockvar)). The final estimates on
the multiply imputed data under model \@ref(eq:r1) can be calculated
(from the `2l.pmm` method) as

```{r mla.ri4}
```

which produces the estimates for the random intercept model with an
effect for IQ with imputed IQ and language scores. See Example 4.2 in
@SNIJDERS2012 for the interpretation of the parameters.

### Random intercepts, contextual model {#sec:wbg}

The ordinary least squares estimator does not distinguish between
regressions within groups and between group. This section shows how we
can allow for differences in the within- and between-group
regressions. The models here parallel Example 4.3 and Table 4.4 in
@SNIJDERS2012, and row 1 in Table 6 of @GRUND2018.

We continue with the analysis of Section \@ref(sec:ri1pred). We extend
the complete-data multilevel model by an extra term, as follows:

$$
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01} {{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_{c} + \gamma_{10} {{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + u_{0c} + \epsilon_{ic}.(\#eq:r2b)
$$

In level notation, we get 

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic} (\#eq:r2level)\\
\beta_{0c}            & = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_{c} + u_{0c} (\#eq:r2levelb)\\
\beta_{1c}            & = \gamma_{10} (\#eq:r2levelc)
\end{align}

where the variable ${{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c$ stands for the
cluster means of `iqv`. The model decomposes the contribution of IQ to
the regression into a within-group component with parameter
$\gamma_{10}$, and a between-group component with parameter
$\gamma_{01}$. The interest in contextual analysis lies in testing the
null hypothesis that $\gamma_{01} = 0$. Because of this decomposition
we need to add the cluster means of `lpo` and `iqv` to the imputation
model. Remember however that we just did that in the FCS imputation
model of Section \@ref(sec:ri1pred). Thus, we may use the same set of
imputations to perform the within- and between-group regressions.

The following code block adds the cluster means to the imputed data,
estimates the model parameters on each set, stores the results in a
list, and pools the estimated parameters from the fitted models to get
the combined results.

```{r mla.riwb1}
```

An alternative could have been to use the `imp2` object with the
imputations under the joint imputation model.

Binary level-1 predictors can be imputed in the same way using one of
the methods listed in Table \@ref(tab:funcmixed). It is not yet clear
which of the methods should be preferred. No univariate methods yet
exist for multi-category variables, but `2l.pmm` may be a workable
alternative. Categorical variables can be imputed by `jomo`
[@QUARTAGNO2017], `jomoImpute` [@MITML], by latent class analysis
[@VIDOTTO2018], or by `Blimp` [@BLIMP].

### Random intercepts, missing level-2 predictor {#sec:ril2}

The previous section extended the substantive model by the cluster
means. Another extension is to add a measured level-2 predictor. For
the sake of illustration we add another variable, religious
denomination of the school, as a level-2 predictor. The corresponding
complete-data model looks very similar:

$$
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01} {{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + \gamma_{10}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + u_{0c} + \epsilon_{ic}. (\#eq:r3level0)
$$

In level notation, we get 

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic} (\#eq:r3level)\\
\beta_{0c}     & = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\texttt{den}}}_{c} + u_{0c} (\#eq:r3levelb)\\
\beta_{1c}     & = \gamma_{10} (\#eq:r3levelc)
\end{align}

The missing values occur in `lpo`, `iqv` and `den`. The difference
with model \@ref(eq:r2b) is that `den` is a measured variable, so the
value is identical for all members of the same cluster. If `den` is
missing, it is missing for the entire cluster. Imputing a missing
level-2 predictor is done by forming an imputation model at the
cluster level.

Imputation can be done with both FCS and JM (cf. Table 6, row 3 in
@GRUND2018). For FCS, the advice is to include aggregates of all
level-1 variables into the cluster level imputation model. Methods
`2lonly.norm` and `2lonly.pmm` add the means of all level-1 variables
as predictors, and subsequently follow the rules for single-level
imputation at level-2.

The following code block imputes missing values in the 2-level
predictor `den`. For reasons of simplicity, I have used `2lonly.pmm`,
so imputations adhere to original four-point scale. This use of
predictive mean matching rests on the assumption that the relative
frequency of the denomination categories changes with a linear
function. Alternatively, one might opt for a true categorical method
to impute `den`, which would introduce additional parameters into the
imputation model.

```{r mla.ril2p1}
```

The following statements address the same imputation task as a joint
model by `jomoImpute`:

```{r mla.ril2p3, cache = TRUE}
```

An alternative is to call `jomoImpute()` from `mice`, as follows:

```{r mla.ril2p4, cache = TRUE}
```

Because `mice` calls `jomoImpute` per replication, the latter method
can be slow because the entire burn-in sequence is re-run for every
call. Inspection of the trace lines revealed that autocorrelations
were low and convergence was quick. To improve speed, the number of
burn-in iterations was lowered from `n.burn = 5000` (default) to
`n.burn = 100`. The total number of iterations was set as `maxit = 1`,
since all variables were members of the same block.

```{r mladens, echo = FALSE, solo = TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:mladens)'}
```

(ref:mladens) Density plots for language score and denomination after
`jomoImpute` (top) and `2l.pmm` (bottom).

Figure \@ref(fig:mladens) shows the density plots of the observed and
imputed data after applying the joint mixed normal/categorical model,
and after predictive mean matching. Both methods handle categorical
data, so the figures for `den` have multiple modes. The imputations of
`lpo` under JM and FCS are very similar, with `jomoImpute` slightly
closer to normality. The complete-data analysis on the multiply
imputed data can be fitted as

```{r mla.ril2p6}
```

### Random intercepts, interactions {#sec:mlint}

The random intercepts model may have predictors at level-1, at
level-2, and possibly interactions within and/or across levels. A
level-2 variable can be a level-1 aggregate (e.g., as in Section
\@ref(sec:wbg)), or a measured level-2 variable (as in Section
\@ref(sec:ril2)). Missing values in the measured variables will
propagate through the interaction terms. This section suggests
imputation methods for the model with random intercepts and
interactions.

We continue with the `brandsma` data, and include three types of
multiplicative interactions among the predictors into the model:

-   a level-1 interaction, e.g.,
    ${{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} \times {{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic}$;

-   a cross-level interaction, e.g.,
    ${{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} \times {{\texttt{den}}}_c$;

-   a level-2 interaction, e.g.,
    ${{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c \times {{\texttt{den}}}_c$.

The extended model in composite notation is defined by:

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = & \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \gamma_{20}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \gamma_{30}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \gamma_{40}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{den}}}_c + \\
 & \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{02}{{\texttt{den}}}_c + \gamma_{03}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c{{\texttt{den}}}_c + u_{0c} + \epsilon_{ic}.
 \end{align}

In level notation, the model is 

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \beta_{2c}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \beta_{3c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic} + \beta_{4c}{{\texttt{sex}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{den}}}_c + \epsilon_{ic}\\
\beta_{0c}     & = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{02}{{\texttt{den}}}_c + \gamma_{03}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c{{\overline{\texttt{den}}}}_c + u_{0c}\\
\beta_{1c}     & = \gamma_{10}\\
\beta_{2c}     & = \gamma_{20}\\
\beta_{3c}     & = \gamma_{30}\\
\beta_{4c}     & = \gamma_{40}\\
\end{align}

How should we impute the missing values in `lpo`, `iqv`, `sex` and
`den`, and obtain valid estimates for the interaction term? @GRUND2018
recommend FCS with passive imputation of the interaction terms. As a
first step, we initialize a number of derived variables.
`                        `
```{r mla.int1}
```

The new variables `lpm`, `iqm` and `sxm` will hold the cluster means
of `lpo`, `iqv` and `sex`, respectively. Variables `iqd` and `lpd`
will hold the values of `iqv` and `lpo` in deviations from their
cluster means. Variables `iqd.sex`, `lpd.sex` and `iqd.lpd` are
two-way interactions of level-1 variables scaled as deviations from
the cluster means. Variables `iqd.den`, `sex.den` and `lpd.den` are
cross-level interactions. Finally, `iqm.den`, `sxm.den` and `lpm.den`
are interactions at level-2. For simplicity, we ignore further level-2
interactions between `iqm`, `sxm` and `lpm`.

The idea is that we impute `lpo`, `iqv`, `sex` and `den`, and update
the other variables accordingly. Level-1 variables are imputed by
two-level predictive mean matching, and include as predictor the other
level-1 variables, the two-way interactions between the other level-1
variables (in deviations from their group means), level-2 variables,
and cross-level interactions.

```{r mla.int2}
```

Level-2 variables are imputed by predictive mean matching on level 2,
using as predictors the aggregated level-1 variables, and the
aggregated two-way interactions of the level-1 variables, and - if
available - other level-2 variables and their two-way interactions.

```{r mla.int2b}
```

The *transpose* of the relevant entries of the predictor matrix
illustrates the symmetric structure of the imputation model.

```{r mla.int2c, echo = FALSE}
```

The entries corresponding to the level-1 predictors are coded with a
`3`, indicating that both the original values as well as the cluster
means of the predictor are included into the imputation model.
Interactions are coded with a `1`. One could also code these with a
`3`, in order to improve compatibility, but this is not done here
because the imputation model becomes too heavy. Because we cannot have
the same variable appearing at both sides of the equation, any
interaction terms involving the target have been deleted from the
conditional imputation models.

The specification above defines the imputation model for the variables
in the data. All other variables (e.g., cluster means, interactions)
are calculated on-the-fly by passive imputation. The code below
centers `iqm` and `lpo` relative to their cluster means.

```{r mla.int4}
```

The `2l.groupmean` method from the `miceadds` package returns the
cluster mean pertaining to each observation. Centering on the cluster
means is widely practiced, but significantly alters the multilevel
model. In the context of imputation, centering on the cluster means
often enhances stability and robustness of models to generate
imputations, especially if interactions are involved. When the
complete-data model uses cluster centering, then the imputation model
should also do so. See Section \@ref(sec:clustermeans) for more
details.

The next block of code specifies the interaction effects, by means of
passive imputation.

```{r mla.int4a}
```

The visit sequence specified below updates the relevant derived
variables after any of the measured variables is imputed, so that
interactions are always in sync. The specification of the imputation
model is now complete, so it can be run with `mice()`.

```{r mla.int5, cache = TRUE}
```

The analysis of the imputed data according to the specified model
first transforms `den` into a categorical variable, and then fits and
pools the mixed model.

```{r mla.int7}
```

### Random slopes, missing outcomes and predictors {#sec:randomslopes}

So far our examples were restricted to models with random intercepts.
We continue here with the contextual model that includes random slopes
for IQ (cf. Example 5.1 in @SNIJDERS2012). Section \@ref(sec:wbg)
showed how to impute the contextual model. Including random slopes
extends the complete-data model as

$$
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_{c} + \gamma_{10}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + u_{0c} + u_{1c} {{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic} (\#eq:rs1)
$$

When expressed in level notation, the model is 

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic} (\#eq:rs1level)\\
\beta_{0c}     & = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_{c} + u_{0c} (\#eq:rs1levelb)\\
\beta_{1c}     & = \gamma_{10} + u_{1c} (\#eq:rs1levelc)
\end{align}

The addition of the term $u_{1c}$ to the equation for $\beta_{1c}$
allows for $\beta_{1c}$ to vary over clusters, hence the name “random
slopes”.

Missing data may occur in `lpo` and `iqv`. @ENDERS2016 and @GRUND2018
recommend FCS for this problem. The procedure is almost identical to
that in Section \@ref(sec:ri1pred), but now including both the cluster
means and random slopes into the imputation model.

```{r mla.rs1, cache = TRUE}
```

The entry of `4` at cell (`lpo`, `iqv`) in the predictor matrix adds
three variables to the imputation model for `lpo`: the value of `iqv`,
the cluster means of `iqv` and the random slopes of `iqv`. Conversely,
imputing `iqv` adds the three covariates: the values of `lpo`, the
cluster means of `lpo` and the random slopes of `lpo`.

The `iqv` variable had zero mean in the data, so this could be imputed
right away, but `lpo` needs to be centered around the grand mean in
order to reduce the large number of warnings about unstable estimates.
It is known that the random slopes model is not invariant to a shift
in origin in the predictors [@HOX2018], so we may wonder what the
effect of centering on the grand mean will be on the quality of the
imputations. See @KREFT1995 and @ENDERS2007 for discussions on the
effects of centering in multilevel models. In imputation, we generally
have no desire to attach a meaning to the parameters of the imputation
model, so centering on the grand mean is often beneficial. Grand-mean
centering implies a little extra work because we must back-transform
the data if we want the values in the original scale. What remains is
that rescaling improves speed and stability, so for the purpose of
imputation I recommend to scale level-1 variables in deviations from
their means.

The following code block unfolds the `mids` object, adds the IQ
cluster means, restores the rescaling of `lpo`, and estimates and
combines the parameters of the random slopes model.

```{r mla.rs2}
```

See Example 5.1 in @SNIJDERS2012 for the interpretation of these model
parameters. Interestingly, if we don’t restore the mean of `lpo`, the
estimated intercept represents the average difference between the
observed and imputed language scores. Its value here is `-0.271` (not
shown), so on average pupils without a language test score a little
lower than pupils with a score. The difference is not statistically
significant ($p = 0.23$).

### Random slopes, interactions {#sec:rsinteractions}

Random slopes models may also include interactions among level-1
predictors, among level-2 predictors, and between level-1 and level-2
predictor (cross-level interactions). This section concentrates on
imputation under the model described in Example 5.3 of @SNIJDERS2012.
This is a fairly elaborate model that can best be understood in level
notation:

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} & = \beta_{0c} + \beta_{1c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \beta_{2c}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic} + \beta_{3c}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic} + \epsilon_{ic} (\#eq:rs2levela)\\
\beta_{0c}     & = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{02}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + \gamma_{03}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + u_{0c} (\#eq:rs2levelb)\\
\beta_{1c}     & = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{12}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + u_{1c} (\#eq:rs2levelc)\\
\beta_{2c}     & = \gamma_{20} + \gamma_{21}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{22}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + u_{2c} (\#eq:rs2leveld)\\
\beta_{3c}     & = \gamma_{30} (\#eq:rs2levele)
\end{align}

which can be reorganized into composite notation as: 

\begin{align}
{{\texttt{lpo}}}_{ic} = & \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{10}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + \gamma_{20}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic} + \gamma_{30}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic} + \\
 & \gamma_{01}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{02}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + \\
 & \gamma_{11}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{12}{{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + \gamma_{21}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c + \gamma_{22}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + \\
 & \gamma_{03}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c + \\
 & u_{0c} + u_{1c} {{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic} + u_{2c} {{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic} + \\
 & \epsilon_{ic}.
\end{align} 
 
Although this expression may look somewhat horrible, it clarifies that
the expected value of `lpo` depends on the following terms:

-   the level-1 variables ${{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}$ and
    ${{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic}$;

-   the level-1 interaction
    ${{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic}$;

-   the cluster means ${{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c$ and
    ${{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c$;

-   the within-variable cross-level interactions
    ${{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c$ and
    ${{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c$;

-   the between-variable cross-level interactions
    ${{\texttt{iqv}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c$ and
    ${{\texttt{ses}}}_{ic}{{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c$;

-   the level-2 interaction
    ${{\overline{\texttt{iqv}}}}_c{{\overline{\texttt{ses}}}}_c$;

-   the random intercepts;

-   the random slopes for `iqv` and `ses`.

All terms need to be included into the imputation model for `lpo`.
Univariate imputation models for `iqv` and `ses` can be specified
along the same principles by reversing the roles of outcome and
predictor. As a first step, let us pad the data with the set of all
relevant interactions from model \@ref(eq:rs2level).

```{r mla.rs3}
```

Here `iqv.ses` represents the multiplicative interaction term for
`iqv` and `ses`, and `lpm` represents the cluster means of `lpo`, and
so on. Imputation models for `lpo`, `iqv` and `ses` are specified by
setting the relevant entries in the *transformed* predictor matrix as
follows:

```{r mla.rs4, echo = FALSE}
```

The model for `lpo` is almost equivalent to model \@ref(eq:rs2level).
According to the model, both cluster means and random effects should
be included, thus values `pred[lpo, c(iqv, ses)]` should be coded as a
`4`, and not as a `3`. However, the cluster means and random effects
are almost linearly dependent, which causes slow convergence and
unstable estimates in the imputation model. These problems disappear
when only the cluster means are included as covariates. An alternative
is to scale the predictors in deviations from the cluster means, as
was done in Section \@ref(sec:mlint). This circumvents many of the
computational issues of raw-scored variables, and the parameters are
easier to interpret.

The specifications for `iqv` and `ses` correspond to the inverted
models. Inverting the random slope model produces reasonable estimates
for the fixed effect and the intercept variance, but estimates of the
slope variance can be unstable and biased, especially in small samples
[@GRUND2016]. Unless the interest is in the slope variance (for which
listwise deletion appears to be better), using FCS by inverting the
random slope model is the currently preferred method to account for
differences in slopes between clusters.

Next, we need to specify the derived variables. The cluster means are
updated by the `2l.groupmean` method.

```{r mla.rs6}
```

The level-1 interactions are updated by passive imputation.

```{r mla.rs5}
```

```{r mla.rs7, echo = FALSE}
```

The remaining interactions are updated by passive imputation in an
analogous way (code not shown).

The visit sequence updates the derived variables that depend on the
target variable.

```{r mla.rs8, cache = TRUE}
```

The model can now be fitted to the full data as

```{r mla.rs9, warning = FALSE}
```

```{r mla.rs10}
```

The estimates are quite close to Table 5.3 in @SNIJDERS2012. These
authors continue with simplifying the model. The same set of
imputations can be used for these simpler models since the imputation
model is more general than the substantive models.

### Recipes {#sec:recipes}

The term “cookbook statistics” is sometimes used to refer to
thoughtless and rigid applications of statistical procedures. Minute
execution of a sequence of steps won’t earn you a Nobel Prize, but a
good recipe will enable you to produce a decent meal from ingredients
that you may not have seen before. The recipes given here are intended
to assist you to create a decent set of imputations for multilevel
data.

Tables \@ref(tab:recipe1) and \@ref(tab:recipe2) contains two recipes
for imputing multilevel data. There are separate recipes for level-1
and level-2 data. The recipes follow the inclusive strategy advocated
by @COLLINS2001, and extend the predictor specification strategy in
Section \@ref(sec:predictors) to multilevel data. Including all
two-way (or higher-order) interactions may quickly inflate the number
of parameters in the model, especially for categorical data, so some
care is needed in selecting the interactions that seem most important
to the application at hand.

Sections \@ref(sec:emptymodel) to \@ref(sec:rsinteractions)
demonstrated applications of these recipes for a variety of multilevel
models. One very important source of information was not yet included.
For clarity, all procedures were restricted to the subset of data that
was actually used in the model. This strategy is not optimal in
general because it fails to include potentially auxiliary information
that is not modeled. For example, the `brandsma` data also contains
the test scores from the same pupils taken one year before the outcome
was measured. This score is highly correlated to the outcome, but it
was not part of the model and hence not used for imputation. Of
course, one could extend the substantive model (e.g., include the
pre-test score as a covariate), but this affects the interpretation
and may not correspond to the question of scientific interest. A
better way is to include these variables only into the imputation
model. This will decrease the between-imputation variability and hence
lead to sharper statistical inferences. Including extra predictive
variables is left as an exercise for the reader.

The procedure in Section \@ref(sec:rsinteractions) may be a daunting
task when the number of variables grows, especially keeping track of
all required interaction effects. The whole process can be automated,
but currently there is no software that will perform these steps
behind the screen. This may be a matter of time. In general, it is
good to be aware of the steps taken, so specification by hand could
also be considered an advantage.

Monitoring convergence is especially important for models with many
random slopes. Warnings from the underlying multilevel routines may
indicate over-specification of the model, for example, with a too
large number of parameters. The imputer should be attentive to such
messages by reducing the complexity of imputation model in the light
of the analytic model. In multilevel modeling, overparameterization
occurs almost always in the variance part of the model. Reducing the
number of random slopes, or simplifying the level-2 model structure
could help to reduce computational complexity.

## Future research

The first edition of this book featured only three pages on multilevel
imputation, and concluded: *“Imputation of multilevel data is an area
where work still remains to be done”* [@VANBUUREN2012 p. 87]. The
progress over the last few years has been tremendous, and we can now
see the contours of an emerging methodology. There are still open
issues, and we may expect to see further advances in the near future.

The multilevel model does not assume the regressions to be identical
in different subsets of the data. This allows for more general and
interesting patterns in the data to be studied, but the added
flexibility comes at the price of increased modeling effort. The
current software needs to become more robust and forgiving, so that
application of multilevel imputation eventually becomes a routine
component of multilevel analysis. We need faster imputation
algorithms, automatic model specification, and good defaults that will
work across a wide variety of practical data types and models. We also
need more experience with imputation in three-level data, and beyond,
e.g., as supported by `Blimp` and `ml.lmer`, as well as more
experience in handling of categorical data with many categories. We
need better insight into the convergence properties, and more
generally into the strengths and limitations of the procedures.

There is little consensus about the optimal way to handle interaction
effects in multiple imputation. I used passive imputation because it
is easy to apply in standard software, and has been found to work
reasonably well. In the future we may see model-based imputation
procedures that enhance the handling of interactions by combining the
imputation and analysis models into larger Bayesian models. See
Section \@ref(sec:modelbased) for some pointers into the literature.
