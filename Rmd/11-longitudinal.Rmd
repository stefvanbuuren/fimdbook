## Long and wide format {#sec:longandwide}

Longitudinal data can be coded into “long” and “wide” formats. A wide
dataset will have one record for each individual. The observations
made at different time points are coded as different columns. In the
wide format every measure that varies in time occupies a set of
columns. In the long format there will be multiple records for each
individual. Some variables that do not vary in time are identical in
each record, whereas other variables vary across the records. The long
format also needs a “time” variable that records the time in each
record, and an “id” variable that groups the records from the same
person.

A simple example of the wide format is

    id age Y1 Y2
     1  14 28 22
     2  12 34 16
     3  ...

In the long format, this dataset looks like

    id age  Y
     1  14 28
     1  14 22
     2  12 34
     2  12 16
     3  ...

Note that the concepts of long and wide are general, and also apply to
cross-sectional data. For example, we have seen the long format before
in Section \@ref(sec:badworkflowb), where it referred to stacked
imputed data that was produced by the `complete()` function. The basic
idea is the same.

Both formats have their advantages. If the data are collected on the
same time points, the wide format has no redundancy or repetition.
Elementary statistical computations like calculating means, change
scores, age-to-age correlations between time points, or the $t$-test
are easy to do in this format. The long format is better at handling
irregular and missed visits. Also, the long format has an explicit
time variable available that can be used for analysis. Graphs and
statistical analyses are easier in the long format.

Applied researchers often collect, store and analyze their data in the
wide format. Classic ANOVA and MANOVA techniques for repeated measures
and structural equation models for longitudinal data assume the wide
format. Modern multilevel techniques and statistical graphs, however,
work only from the long format. The distinction between the two formats
is a first stumbling block for those new to longitudinal analysis.

@SINGER2003 advise to store data in both formats. The wide and
the long formats can be easily converted in another by means of
`gather()` and `spread()` functions on `tidyr` [@WICKHAM2017]. The
wide-to-long conversion can usually be done without a problem. The
long-to-wide conversion can be difficult. If individuals are seen at
different times, direct conversion is impractical. The number of
columns in the wide format becomes overly large, and each column
contains many missing values. An ad hoc solution is to create
homogeneous time groups, which then become the new columns in the wide
format. Such regrouping will lead to loss of precision of the time
variable. For some studies this need not be a problem, but for others
it will.

Multiple imputation is somewhat more convenient in the wide format.
Apart from the fact that the columns are ordered in time, there is
nothing special about the imputation problem. We may thus apply
techniques for single level data to longitudinal data. Section
\@ref(sec:fdd) discusses an imputation technique in the wide format in
a clinical trial application with the goal of performing a statistical
analysis according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle. The
longitudinal character of the data helped specify the imputation
model.

Multiple imputation of the longitudinal data in the long form can be
done by multilevel imputation techniques. See Chapter
\@ref(ch:multilevel) for an overview. Section \@ref(sec:rastering)
discusses multiple imputation in the long format. The application
defines a common time raster for all persons. Multiple imputations are
drawn for each raster point. The resulting imputed datasets can be
converted to, and analyzed in, the wide format if desired. This
approach is a more principled way to deal with the information loss
problem discussed previously. The procedure aligns times to a common
raster, hence the name *time raster imputation* (cf. Section
\@ref(sec:rastering)).

## SE Fireworks Disaster Study {#sec:fdd}

On May 13, 2000, a catastrophic fireworks explosion occurred at SE
Fireworks in Enschede, the Netherlands. The explosion killed 23 people
and injured about 950. Around 500 houses were destroyed, leaving 1250
people homeless. Ten thousand residents were evacuated.

The disaster marked the starting point of a major operation to recover
from the consequences of the explosion. Over the years, the
neighborhood has been redesigned and rebuilt. Right after the
disaster, the evacuees were relocated to improvised housing. Those in
need received urgent medical care. A considerable number of residents
showed signed of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This disorder
is associated with flashback memories, avoidance of behaviors, places,
or people that might lead to distressing memories, sleeping disorders
and emotional numbing. When these symptoms persist and disrupt normal
daily functioning, professional treatment is indicated.

Amidst the turmoil in the aftermath, Mediant, the disaster health
after-care center, embedded a randomized controlled trial comparing
two treatments for anxiety-related disorders: eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) [@SHAPIRO2001] and cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) [@STALLARD2006]. CBT is the standard therapy.
The data collection started within one year of the explosion, and
lasted until the year 2004 [@DEROOS2011]. The study included $n$ = 52
children 4-18 years, as well as their parents. Children were
randomized to EMDR or CBT by a flip of the coin. Each group contained
26 children.

The children received up to four individual sessions over a 4-8 week
period, along with up to four parent sessions. Blind assessment took
place pre-treatment (T1) and post-treatment (T2) and at 3 months
follow-up (T3). The primary outcomes were the UCLA PTSD Reaction Index
(PTSD-RI) [@STEINBERG2004], the Child Report of Post-traumatic
Symptoms (CROPS) and the Parent Report of Post-traumatic Symptoms
(PROPS) [@GREENWALD1999]. Treatment was stopped if children were
asymptomatic according to participant and parent verbal report (both
conditions), or if there was no remaining distress associated with the
trauma memory, as indicated by a self-reported Subjective Units of
Disturbance Scale (SUDS) of 0 (EMDR condition only).

The objective of the study was to answer the following questions:

-   Is one of these treatments more effective in reducing PTSD symptoms
    at T2 and T3?

-   Does the number of sessions needed to produce the therapeutic effect
    differ between the treatments?

  : (\#tab:fdddata) SE Fireworks Disaster Study. The UCLA PTSD
  Reaction Index of 52 subjects, children and parents, randomized to
  EMDR or CBT.

Table \@ref(tab:fdddata) contains the outcome data of all subjects.
The columns labeled $Y^c_t$ contain the child data, and the columns
labeled $Y^p_t$ contain the parent data at time $t$ = (1, 2, 3).
Children under the age of 6 years did not fill in the child form, so
their scores are missing.

Of the 52 initial participants 14 children (8 EMDR, 6 CBT) did not
follow the protocol. The majority (11) of this group did not receive
the therapy, but still provided outcome measurements. The three others
received therapy, but failed to provide outcome measures. The combined
group is labeled as “drop-out,” while the other group is called the
“completers” or “per-protocol” group. Figure \@ref(fig:fddpattern)
shows the missing data patterns for both groups.

```

(ref:fddpattern) Missing data patterns for the “per-protocol” group
(left) and the “drop-out” group (right).

The main reason given for dropping out was that the parents were
overburdened (8). Other reasons for dropping out were: refusing to
talk (1), language problems (1) and a new trauma rising to the
forefront (2). One adolescent refused treatment from a therapist not
belonging to his own culture (1). One child showed spontaneous
recovery before treatment started (1).

Comparison between the 14 drop-outs and the 38 completers regarding
presentation at time of initial assessment yielded no significant
differences in any of the demographic characteristics or number of
traumatic experiences. On the symptom scales, only the mean score of
the PROPS was marginally significantly higher for the drop-out group
than for the treatment completers ($t$ = 2.09, $\mathrm{df}$ = 48, $p$
= .04).

Though these preliminary analyses are comforting, the best way to
analyze the data is to the compare participants in the groups to which
they were randomized, regardless of whether they received or adhered
to the allocated intervention. Formal statistical testing requires
random assignment to groups. The intention to treat (ITT) principle is
widely recommended as the preferred approach to the analysis of
clinical trials. @DEMETS2008 and @WHITE2011B provide balanced
discussions of pros and cons of ITT.

### Imputation model {#imputation-model-1}

The major problem of the ITT principle is that some of the data that
are needed are missing. Multiple imputation is a natural way to solve
this problem, and thus to enable ITT analyses.

A difficulty in setting up the imputation model in the SE Fireworks
Disaster Study is the large number of outcome variables relative to
the number of cases. Even though the analysis of the data in Table
\@ref(tab:fdddata) is already challenging, the real dataset is more
complex than this. There are six additional outcome variables (e.g.,
the Child Behavior Checklist, or CBCL), each measured over time and
similarly structured as in Table \@ref(tab:fdddata). In addition, some
of the outcome measures are to be analyzed on both the subscale level
and the total score level. For example, the PTSD-RI has three
subscales (intrusiveness/numbing/avoidance, fear/anxiety, and
disturbances in sleep and concentration and two additional summary
measures (full PTSD and partial PTSD). All in all, there were 65
variables in data to be analyzed. Of these, 49 variables were
incomplete. The total number of cases was 52, so in order to avoid
grossly overdetermined models, the predictors of the imputation model
should be selected very carefully.

A first strategy for predictor reduction was to preserve all
deterministic relations columns in the incomplete data. This was done
by passive imputation. For example, let $Y^p_{a,1}$, $Y^p_{b,1}$ and
$Y^p_{c,1}$ represent the scores on three subscales of the PTSD parent
form administered at T1. Each of these is imputed individually. The
total variable $Y^p_1$ is then imputed by `mice` in a deterministic
way as the sum score.

A second strategy to reduce the number of predictors was to leave out
other outcomes, measured at other time points. To illustrate this, a
subset of the predictor matrix for imputing $Y^p_{a,1}$, $Y^p_{b,1}$
and $Y^p_{c,1}$ is:

```{r fddpred}
```

The conditional distribution 
$P(Y^p_{a,1}|Y^p_{b,1}, Y^p_{c,1}, Y^p_{a,2}, Y^p_{a,3})$ leaves out
the cross-lagged predictors $Y^p_{b,2}$, $Y^p_{c,2}$, $Y^p_{b,3}$ and
$Y^p_{c,3}$. The assumption is the cross-lagged predictors are
represented by through their non-cross-lagged predictors. Applying
this idea consistently throughout the entire 65 $\times$ 65 predictor
matrix brings vast reductions of the number of predictors. The largest
number of predictors for any incomplete variable was 23, which still
leaves degrees of freedom for residual variation.

Specifying a 65 $\times$ 65 predictor matrix by syntax in `R` is
tedious and prone to error. I copied the variable names to Microsoft
Excel, defined a square matrix of small cells containing zeroes, and
used the menu option `Conditional formatting...` to define a cell
color if the cell contains a “1.” The option `Freeze Panes` was
helpful for keeping variable names visible at all times. After filling
in the matrix with the appropriate patterns of ones, I exported it to
`R` to be used as argument to the `mice()` function. Excel is
convenient for setting up large, patterned imputation models.

The imputations were generated as

```{r fddimpute, cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
```

### Inspecting imputations

For plotting purposes we need to convert the imputed data into long
form. In `R` this can be done as follows:

```{r fddreshape}
```

This code executes two wide-to-long transformations in succession. The
data are imputed in wide format. The call to `complete()` writes the
$m$ + 1 imputed stacked datasets to `lowi`, which stands for
“long-wide.” The `data.frame()` statement appends three columns to the
data with missing CBCL scores, since the CBCL was not administered at
time point 2. The `reshape()` statement interprets everything from
column 11 onward as time-varying variables. As long as the variables
are labeled consistently, `reshape()` will be smart enough to identify
groups of columns that belong together, and stack them in the
double-long format `lolo`. Finally, the result is sorted such that the
original data with `lolo$.imp==0` are stored as the first block.

```{r fddplotimp, echo = FALSE, fig.asp = 1, fig.cap = '(ref:fddplotimp)'}
```

(ref:fddplotimp) Plot of the multiply imputed data of the 13 subjects
with one or more missing values on PTSD-RI parent form.

Figure \@ref(fig:fddplotimp) plots the profiles from 13 subjects with
a missing score on $Y^p_1$, $Y^p_2$ or $Y^p_3$ in Table
\@ref(tab:fdddata). Some profiles are partially imputed. Examples are
subjects 7 (missing T1) and 37 (missing T2). Other profiles are
missing entirely, and are thus completely imputed. Examples are
subjects 2 and 43. Similar plots can be made for other outcomes. In
general, the imputed profiles look similar to the completely observed
profiles (not shown).

### Complete-data model

In the absence of missing data, we would have liked to perform a
classical repeated measures MANOVA as in @POTTHOFF1964. This method
construct derived variables that represent time as polynomial
contrasts that can be tested. An appealing feature of the method is
that the covariances among the repeated measures can take any form.

Let $y_{ikt}$ denote the measurement of individual $i$
($i=1,\dots,n_k$) in group $k$ (CBT or EMDR) at time point $t$
($t=1,\dots,n_t$). In the SE Fireworks Disaster Study data, we have
$n_k=26$ and $n_t=3$. All subjects have been measures at the same time
points. The model represents the time trend in each group by a linear
and quadratic trend as

$$
  y_{ikt}=\beta_{k0}+t \beta_{k1} + t^2 \beta_{k2} + e_{ikt} (\#eq:1)
$$ 

where the subject residual $e_i$ has an arbitrary covariance 3
$\times$ 3 matrix $\Sigma$ that is common to both groups. This model
has six $\beta$ parameters, three for each treatment group. To answer
the first research question, we would be interested in testing the
null hypotheses $\beta_{11}=\beta_{21}$ and $\beta_{12}=\beta_{22}$,
i.e., whether the linear and quadratic trends are different between
the treatment groups.

@POTTHOFF1964 showed how this model can be transformed into the usual
  MANOVA model and be fitted by standard software. Suppose that the
  repeated measures are collected in variables `Y1`, `Y2` and `Y3`. In
  `SPSS` we can use the `GLM` command to test for the hypothesis of
  linear and quadratic time trends, and for the hypothesis that these
  trends are different between CBT and EMDR groups. Though application
  of the method is straightforward for complete data, it cannot be
  used directly for the SE Fireworks Disaster Study, because of the
  missing data.

The `mids` object created by `mice()` can be exported as a multiply
imputed dataset to `SPSS` by means of the `mids2spss()` function. If
the data came originally from `SPSS` it is also possible to merge the
imputed data with the original data by means of the `UPDATE` command.
`SPSS` will recognize an imported multiply imputed dataset, and
execute the analysis $m$ times in parallel. It can also provide the
pooled statistics. Note that pooling requires a license to the Missing
Values module.

Unfortunately, in `SPSS` 18.0 pooling is not implemented for `GLM`. As
a solution, I stored the results by means of the `OMS` command in
`SPSS` and shipped the output back to `R` for further analysis. I then
applied a yet unpublished procedure for pooling $F$-tests to the
datasets stored by the `OMS` command. In this way, pooling procedures
that are not built into `SPSS` can be done with `mice`.

Of course, I could have saved myself the trouble of exporting the
imputed data to `SPSS` and performed all analyses in `R`. That would,
however, lock out the investigator from her own data. With the new
pooling facilities investigators can now do their own data analysis on
multiply imputed data. Some re-exporting is therefore worthwhile.

An alternative could have been to create the multiply imputed datasets
within `SPSS`. This option was not possible for these data because the
`MULTIPLE IMPUTATION` command in `SPSS` does not support predictor
selection and passive imputation. With a bit of conversion between
software packages, it is possible to have best of both worlds.

development of the mean level of PTSD complaint according to the
PTSD-RI. All curves display a strong downward trend between start of
treatment (T1) and end of treatment (T2), which is presumably caused
by the EMDR and CBT therapies. The shape between end of treatment (T2)
and follow-up (T3) differs somewhat for the group, suggesting that
EMDR has better long-term effects, but this difference was not
statistically significant. Also note that the complete-case analysis
and the analysis based on ITT are in close agreement with each other
here.

We will not go into details here to answer the second research
question as stated on page . It is of interest to note that EMDR
needed fewer sessions to achieve its effect. The original publication
[@DEROOS2011] contains the details.

## Time raster imputation {#sec:rastering}

Longitudinal analysis has become virtually synonymous with mixed
effects modeling. Following the influential work of @LAIRD1982 and
@JENNRICH1986, this approach characterizes individual growth
trajectories by a small number of random parameters. The differences
between individuals are expressed in terms of these parameters.

In some applications, it is natural to consider *change scores*.
Change scores are however rather awkward within the context of mixed
effects models. This section introduces *time raster imputation*, a
new method to generate imputations on a regular time raster from
irregularly spaced longitudinal data. The imputed data can then be
used to calculate change scores or age-to-age correlations, or apply
quantitative techniques designed for repeated measures.

### Change score

Let $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ represent repeated measurements of the same object
at times $T_1$ and $T_2$ where $T_1<T_2$. The difference
$\Delta=Y_2-Y_1$ is the most direct measure of change over time.
@WILLETT1989 [p. 588] characterized the change score as an
“intuitive, unbiased, and computationally-simple measure of individual
growth.”

One would expect that modern books on longitudinal data would take the
change score as their starting point. That is not the case. The change
score is fully absent from most current books on longitudinal analysis.
For example, there is no entry “change score” in the index of
@VERBEKE2000, @DIGGLE2002, @WALLS2006 or @FITZMAURICE2009. @SINGER2003
[p. 10] do discuss the change score, but they quickly dismiss it on the
basis that a study with only two time points cannot reveal the shape of
a person’s growth trajectory.

The change score, once the centerpiece of longitudinal analysis, has
disappeared from the methodological literature. I find this is
somewhat unfortunate as the parameters in the mixed effects model are
more difficult to interpret than the change score. Moreover, classic
statistical techniques, like the paired $t$-test or split-plot ANOVA,
are built on the change score. There is a gap between modern mixed
effects models and classical linear techniques for change scores and
repeated measures data.

Calculating a mean change score is only sensible if different persons
are measured at the same time points. When the data are observed at
irregular times, there is no simple way to calculate change scores.
Calculating change scores from the person parameters of the mixed
effects model is technically trivial, but such scores are difficult to
interpret. The person parameters are fitted values that have been
smoothed. Deriving a change score as the difference between the fitted
curve of the person at $T_1$ and $T_2$ results in values that are
closer to zero than those derived from data that have been observed.

This section describes a technique that inserts pseudo time points to
the observed data of each person. The outcome data at these
supplementary time points are multiply imputed. The idea is that the
imputed data can be analyzed subsequently by techniques for change
scores and repeated measures.

The imputation procedure is akin to the process needed to print a
photo in a newspaper. The photo is coded as points on a predefined
raster. At the microlevel there could be information loss, but the
scenery is essentially unaffected. Hence the name *time raster
imputation*. My hope is that this method will help bridge the gap
between modern and classic approaches to longitudinal data.

### Scientific question: Critical periods {#sec:tbcquestion}

The research was motivated by the question: *At what ages do children
become overweight?* Knowing the answer to this question may provide
handles for preventive interventions to counter obesity.

[@DIETZ1994] suggested the existence of three *critical periods* for
obesity at adult age: the prenatal period, the period of adiposity
rebound (roughly around the age of 5-6 years), and adolescence.
Obesity that begins at these periods is expected to increase the risk
of persistent obesity and its complications. Overviews of studies on
critical periods are given by @CAMERON2002 and @LLOYD2010.

In the sequel, we use the body mass index (BMI) as a measure of
overweight. BMI will be analyzed in standard deviation scores (SDS)
using the relevant Dutch references [@FREDRIKS2000B; @FREDRIKS2000A].
Our criterion for being overweight in adulthood is defined as BMI SDS
$\geq$ 1.3.

As an example, imagine an 18-year-old person with a BMI SDS equal to
+1.5 SD. How did this person end up at 1.5 SD? If we have the data, we
can plot the measurements against age, and study the individual track.
The BMI SDS trajectory may provide key insights into development of
overweight and obesity.

```{r trajectories, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:trajectories)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/ch11_trajectories.png")
```

(ref:trajectories) Five theoretical BMI SDS trajectories for a person
age 18 years with a BMI SDS = 1.5 SD.

Figure \@ref(fig:trajectories) provides an overview of five
theoretical BMI SDS trajectories that the person might have followed.
These are:

1.  *Long critical period*. A small but persistent centile crossing
    across the entire age range. In this case, everything (or nothing)
    is a critical period.

2.  *No critical period*. The person is born with a BMI SDS of 1.5 SD
    and this remains unaltered throughout age.

3.  *Short early*. There is a large increase between ages 2y and 5y. We
    would surely interpret the period 2y-5y is as a critical period for
    this person.

4.  *Short late*. This is essentially the same as before, but shifted
    forward in time.

5.  *Two critical periods*. Here the total increase of 1.5 SD is spread
    over two periods. The first occurs at 2y-5y with an increase of
    1.0 SD. The second at 12y-15y with an increase of 0.5 SD.

In practice, mixing between these and other forms will occur.

The objective is to identify any periods during childhood that
contribute to an increase in overweight at adult age. A period is
“critical” if

1.  change differs between those who are and are not later overweight;
    and

2.  change is associated with the outcome after correction for the
    measure at the end of the period.

Both need to hold. In order to solve the problem of irregular age
spacing, @DEKROON2010 use the *broken stick model*, a piecewise linear
growth curve fitted, as a means to describe individual growth curves
at fixed times.

This section extends this methodology by generating imputations
according to the broken stick model. The multiply imputed values are
then used to estimate difference scores and regression models that
throw light on the question of scientific interest.

```{r tbcinit, echo = FALSE}
```

### Broken stick model$^\spadesuit$ {#sec:brokenstick}

In a sample of $n$ persons $i=1,\dots,n$, we assume that there are
$n_i$ measurement occasions for person $i$. Let $y_i$ represent the
$n_i\times 1$ vector containing the SDS values obtained for person
$i$. Let $t_i$ represent the $n_i\times 1$ vector with the ages at
which the measurements were made.

The broken stick model requires the user to specify an ordered set of
$k$ break ages, collected in the vector
$\kappa=(\kappa_1,\dots,\kappa_k)$. The set should cover the entire
range of the measured ages, so $\kappa_1 \leq \min(t_i)$ and $\kappa_k
\geq \max(t_i)$ for all $i$. It is convenient to set $\kappa_1$ and
$\kappa_k$ to rounded values just below and above the minimum and
maximum ages in the data, respectively. @DEKROON2010 specified nine
break ages: birth (0d), 8 days (8d), 4 months (4m), 1 year (1y), 2
years (2y), 6 years (6y), 10 years (10y), 18 years (18y) and 29 years
(29y).

Without loss of information, the time points $t_i$ of person $i$ are
represented by a $B$-spline of degree 1, with knots specified by
$\kappa$. More specifically, the vector $t_i$ is recoded as the
$n_i\times k$ design matrix $X_i=(x_{1i},\dots,x_{ki})$. We refer to
@RUPPERT2003 [p. 59] for further details. For the set of break ages
we calculate the $B$-splines matrix in `R` by the `bs()` function from
the `splines` package as follows:

```{r tbcspline}
```

Matrix $X$ has only two nonzero elements in each row. Each row sums to
1. If an observed age coincides with a break age, the corresponding
entry is equal to 1, and all remaining elements are zero. In the data
example, this occurs in the first record, at birth. A small constant
of 0.0001 was added to the last break age. This was done to
accommodate for a pseudo time point with an exact age of 29 years,
which will be inserted later in Section \@ref(sec:tbcimpute).

The measurements $y_i$ for person $i$ are modeled by the linear mixed
effects model

\begin{align}
y_i & = X_i(\beta + \beta_i) + \epsilon_i (\#eq:bs) \\
    & = X_i\gamma_i + \epsilon_i \nonumber
\end{align}

where $\gamma_i=\beta + \beta_i$. The $k\times 1$ column vector
$\beta$ contains $k$ fixed-effect coefficients common to all persons.
The vector $\beta_i$ contains $k$ subject-specific random effect
coefficients for person $i$. The vector $\epsilon_i$ contains $n_i$
subject-specific residuals.

We make the usual assumption that $\gamma_i\sim N(\beta,\Omega)$,
i.e., the random coefficients of the subjects have a multivariate
normal distribution with global mean $\beta$ and an unstructured
covariance $\Omega$. We also assume that the residuals are
independently and normally distributed as 
$\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2 I(n_i))$ where $\sigma^2$ is a common
variance parameter. The covariances between $\beta_i$ and $e_i$ are
assumed to be zero.

Since the rows of the $B$-spline basis all sum to 1, the intercept is
implicit. In fact, one could interpret the model as a special form of
the random intercept model, where the intercept is represented by a
$B$-spline rather than by the usual column of ones.

The model prescribes that growth follows a straight line between the
break ages. In this application, we are not so much interested in what
happens *within* the age interval of each period. @ROGOSA1985
contrasted the analysis of individual differences based on change
scores with the analysis of individual differences based on multilevel
parameters. They concluded that in general the analysis of change
scores is inferior to the parameter approach. The exception is when
growth is assumed to follow a straight line within the interval of
interest. In that case, the change score approach and the mixed
effects model are interchangeable [@ROGOSA1985 p. 225]. The straight
line assumption is often reasonable in epidemiological studies if the
time interval is short [@HUI1983]. For extra detail, we could add an
extra break age within the interval.

The function `lmer()` from the `lme4` package fits the model. Change
scores can be calculated from the fixed and random effects as follows:

```{r tbcfitstick, eval=FALSE}
```

The $\hat\gamma_i$ estimates are found in the variable `tsiz`. Let
$\hat\delta_{ik}=\hat\gamma_{i,j+1}-\hat\gamma_{i,j}$ with
$j=1,\dots,k-1$ denote the successive differences (or increments) of
the elements in $\hat\gamma_i$. These are found in the variable
`tinc`. We may interpret $\hat\delta_i$ as the expected change scores
for person $i$.

The first criterion for a critical period is that change differs between
those who are and are not later overweight. A simple analysis for this
criterion is the Student’s $t$-test applied to $\hat\delta_{ik}$ for
every period $k$. The correlations between $\hat\delta_{ik}$ at
successive $k$ were generally higher than 0.5, so we analyzed
unconditional change scores [@JONES2009]. The second criterion for a
critical period involves fitting two regression models, both of which
have final BMI SDS at adulthood, denoted by $\gamma_i^\mathrm{adult}$,
as their outcome. The two models are: 

\begin{align}
  \gamma_i^\mathrm{adult} & = \hat\gamma_{i,j+1}\zeta_{j+1} + \epsilon_i \\
  \gamma_i^\mathrm{adult} & = \hat\gamma_{i,j+1}\eta_{j+1} + \hat\gamma_j\eta_j + \varepsilon_i
\end{align}

which are fitted for $j=1,\dots,k-2$. The parameter of scientific
interest is the added value of including $\eta_j$.

### Terneuzen Birth Cohort

The Terneuzen Birth Cohort consists of all ($n$ = 2604) newborns in
Terneuzen, the Netherlands, between 1977 and 1986. The most recent
measurements were made in the year 2005, so the data spans an age range
of 0-29 years. Height and weight were measured throughout this age
range. More details on the measurement procedures and the data can be
found in @DEKROON2008 [@DEKROON2010].

Suppose the model is fitted to weight SDS. The parameters $\gamma_i$
can be interpreted as attained weight SDS relative to the reference
population. This allows us to represent the observed trajectory of
each child in a condensed way by $k$ numbers. The values in
$\hat\gamma_i$ are the set of most likely weight SDS values at each
break age, given all true measurements we have of child $i$. This
implies that if the child has very few measurements, the estimates
will be close to the global mean. When taken together, the values
$\hat\gamma_i$ form the broken stick.

```{r tbcplotstick, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:tbcplotstick)'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/ch11_tbcplotstick.png")
```

(ref:tbcplotstick) Broken stick trajectories for weight SDS from six
selected individuals from the Terneuzen cohort.

Figure \@ref(fig:tbcplotstick) displays weight SDS against age for six
selected individuals. Child 1259 has a fairly common pattern. This
child starts off near the average, but then steadily declines, apart
from a blip around 10months. Child 2447 is fairly constant, but had a
major valley near the age of 4months, perhaps because of a temporary
illness. Child 7019 is also typical. The pattern hovers around the
mean. Observe that no data beyond 10 years are available for this
child. Child 7460 experienced a substantial change in the
height/weight proportions during the first year. Child 7646 was born
prematurely with a gestational age of 32 weeks. This individual has an
unusually large increase in weight between birth and puberty. Child
8046 is aberrant with an unusually large number of weight measurements
around the age of 8 days, but was subsequently not measured for about
1.5 years.

Figure \@ref(fig:tbcplotstick) also displays the individual broken
stick estimates for each outcome as a line. Observe that the model
follows the individual data points very well. @DEKROON2010 analyzed
these estimates by the methods described at the end of Section
\@ref(sec:tbcquestion), and found that the periods 2y-6y and 10y-18y
were most relevant for developing later overweight.

### Shrinkage and the change score$^\spadesuit$ {#sec:shrinkage}

Thus far we have looked at the problem from a prediction perspective.
This is a useful first step, but it does not address all aspects. The
$\hat\beta_i$ estimate in the mixed effects model combines the
person-specific ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of $\beta_i$
with the grand mean $\hat\beta$. The amount of shrinkage toward the
grand mean depends on three factors: the number of data points $n_i$,
the residual variance estimate $\hat\sigma^2$ around the fitted broken
stick, and the variance estimate $\hat\omega_j^2$ for the
$j^\mathrm{th}$ random effect. If $n_i=\sigma^2/\hat\omega_j^2$ then
$\hat\beta_i$ is halfway between $\hat\beta$ and the OLS estimate of
$\beta_i$. If $n_i < \hat\sigma^2/\omega_j^2$ then $\hat\beta_i$ is
closer to the global mean, while $n_i > \hat\sigma^2/\hat\omega_j^2$
implies that $\hat\beta_i$ is closer to the OLS-estimate. We refer to
@GELMAN2007 [p. 394] for more details.

Shrinkage will stabilize the estimates of persons with few data
points. Shrinkage also implies that the same 
$\hat\gamma_i = \hat\beta+\hat\beta_i$ can correspond to quite
different data trajectories. Suppose profile A is an essentially flat
and densely measured trajectory just above the mean. Profile B, on the
other hand, is a sparse and highly variable trajectory far above the
mean. Due to differential shrinkage, profiles A and B can have the
same $\hat\gamma_i$ estimates. As a consequence, shrinkage will affect
the change scores $\hat\delta_i$. For both profiles A and B the
estimated change scores $\hat\delta_i$ are approximately zero at every
period. For profile A this is reasonable since the profile itself is
flat. In profile B we would expect to see substantial variation in
$\hat\delta_i$ if the data had been truly measured. Yet, shrinkage has
dampened $\hat\gamma_i$, and thus made $\hat\delta_i$ closer to zero
than if calculated from observed data.

It is not quite known whether this effect is a problem in this
application. It is likely that dampening of $\hat\delta_i$ will bias
the result in the conservative direction, and hence primarily affects
statistical power. The next section explores an alternative based on
multiple imputation. The idea is to insert the break ages into the
data, and impute the corresponding outcome data.

### Imputation {#sec:tbcimpute}

The measured outcomes are denoted by $Y_\mathrm{obs}$, e.g., weight
SDS. For the moment, we assume that the $Y_\mathrm{obs}$ are coded in
long format and complete, though neither is an essential requirement.
For each person $i$ we append $k$ records, each of which corresponds
to a break age. In `R` we first set up a time warping model that
connect real age to warped age, and then integrate the new ages into
the data.

```{r tbctimewarp}
```

The function `appendbreak()` is a custom function of about 20 lines in
`mice` specific to the Terneuzen Birth Cohort data. It copies the
first available record of the $i^\mathrm{th}$ person $k$ times,
updates administrative and age variables, sets the outcome variables
to `NA`, appends the result to the original data and sorts the result
with respect to `id` and `age`. The real data are thus mingled with
the supplementary records with missing outcomes. The first few records
of `data2` look like this:

```{r tbcdecimal, echo = FALSE}
```
```{r tbcappenddata}
```

Multiple imputation must take into account that the data are clustered
within persons. The setup for `mice()` requires some care, so we
discuss each step in detail.

```{r tbcimpmeth}
```

These statements specify that only `hgt.z`, `wgt.z` and `bmi.z` need
to be imputed. For these three outcomes we request the elementary
imputation function `mice.impute.2l.pan()`, which is designed to
impute data with two levels. See Section \@ref(sec:multioutcome) for
more detail.

```{r tbcimppred}
```

The setup of the predictor matrix needs some care. We first empty all
entries from the variable `pred`. The statement `pred[Y, id] <- (-2)`
defines variable `id` as the class variable. The statement `pred[Y,
sex] <- 1` specifies `sex` as a fixed effect, as usual, while `pred[Y,
paste(x, 1:9, sep = )] <- 2` sets the $B$-spline basis as a random
effect, as in Equation \@ref(eq:bs). The remaining three statement
specify the $Y_2$ is a random effects predictor of $Y_1$ (and vice
versa), and both $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are random effects predictors of
$Y_3$. Note that $Y_3$ (BMI SDS) is not a predictor of $Y_1$ or $Y_2$
in order to prevent the type of convergence problems explained in
Section \@ref(sec:convergence). Note also that age is not included in
order to evade duplication with its $B$-spline coding. In summary,
there are 12 random effects (9 for age and 3 for the outcomes), one
class variable, and one fixed effect.

```{r tbcimpvis, echo = FALSE}
```

The actual imputations are produced by

```{r tbcimpmice, eval = FALSE}
```

There are over 48000 records. This call takes about 30 minutes to
complete, which is much longer than the other applications discussed
in this book. In the year 2012 the same problem still took over 10
hours, so there is certainly progress.

```

(ref:tbcplotimp) Ten multiply imputed trajectories of weight SDS for
the same persons as in Figure \@ref(fig:tbcplotstick) (in red). Also
shown are the data points (in blue).

Figure \@ref(fig:tbcplotimp) displays ten multiply imputed
trajectories for the six persons displayed in Figure
\@ref(fig:tbcplotstick). The general impression is that the imputed
trajectory follows the data quite well. At ages where the are many
data points (e.g., in period 0d-1y in person 1259 or in period 8d-1y
in person 7460) the curves are quite close, indicating a relatively
large certainty. On the other hand, at locations where data are sparse
(e.g., the period 10y-29y in person 7019, or the period 8d-2y in
person 8046) the curves diverge, indicating a large amount of
uncertainty about the imputation. This effect is especially strong at
the edges of the age range. Incidentally, we noted that the end
effects are less pronounced for larger sample sizes.

(ref:tbchw) The relation between height SDS and weight SDS in the
observed (blue) and imputed (red) longitudinal trajectories. The
imputed data occur exactly at the break ages. The observed data come
from the period immediately after the break age. No data beyond 29
years were observed, so the upper-right panel contains no observed
data.

It is also interesting to study whether imputation preserves the
relation between height, weight and BMI. Figure \@ref(fig:tbchw) is a
scattergram of height SDS and weight SDS split according to age that
superposes the imputations on the observed data in the period after
the break point. In general the relation in the observed data is
preserved in the imputed data. Note that the imputations become more
variable for regions with fewer data. This is especially visible at
the panel in the upper-right corner at age 29y, where there were no
data at all. Similar plots can be made in combination with BMI SDS. In
general, the data in these plots all behave as one would expect.

### Complete-data model

Table \@ref(tab:tbcresult) provides a comparison of the mean changes
observed under the broken stick model and under time raster
imputation. The estimates are very similar, so the mean change
estimated under both methods is similar. The $p$-values in the broken
stick method are generally more optimistic relative to multiple
imputation, which is due to the fact that the broken stick model
ignores the uncertainty about the estimates.

There is also an effect on the correlations. In general, the
age-to-age correlations of the broken stick method are higher than the
raster imputations.

  : (\#tab:tbccorr) Age-to-age correlations of BMI SDS the broken
  stick estimates (lower triangle) and raster imputations (upper
  triangle) for the Terneuzen Birth Cohort ($n$ = 1745).

Table \@ref(tab:tbccorr) provides the age-to-age correlation matrix of
BMI SDS estimated from 1745 cases from the Terneuzen Birth Cohort.
Apart from the peculiar values for the age of 8 days, the correlations
decrease as the period between time points increases. The values for
the broken stick method are higher because these do not incorporate
the uncertainty of the estimates.

## Conclusion

This chapter described techniques for imputing longitudinal data in
both the wide and long formats. Some things are easier in the wide
format, e.g., change scores or imputing data, while other procedures
are easier in the long format, e.g., graphics and advanced statistical
modeling. It is therefore useful to have both formats available.

The methodology for imputing data in the wide format is not really
different from that of cross-sectional data. When possible, always try
to convert the data into the wide format before imputation. If the
data have been observed at irregular time points, as in the Terneuzen
Birth Cohort, conversion of the data into the wide format is not
possible, however, and imputation can be done in the long format by
multilevel imputation.

This chapter introduced time raster imputation, a technique for
converting data with an irregular age spacing into the wide format by
means of imputation. Time rastering seems to work well in the sense
that the generated trajectories follow the individual trajectories.
The technique is still experimental and may need further refinement
before it can be used routinely.

The current method inserts missing data at the full time grid, and
thus imputes data even at time points where there are real
observations. One obvious improvement would be to strip such points
from the grid so that they are not imputed. For example, in the
Terneuzen Birth Cohort this means that we would always take observed
birth weight when it is measured.

Another potential improvement is to use the OLS estimates within each
cluster as the center of the posterior predictive distribution rather
than their shrunken versions. This would decrease within cluster
variability in the imputations, and increase between cluster
variability. It is not yet clear how to deal with clusters with only a
few time points, but this modification is likely to produce age-to-age
correlations that are most faithful to the data.

Finally, the selection of the data could be much stricter. The
analysis of the Terneuzen Birth Cohort data used a very liberal
inclusion criterion that requires a minimum of only three data points
across the entire age range. Sparse trajectories will have large
imputation variances, and may thus bias the age-to-age correlations
toward zero. As a preliminary rule of thumb, there should be at least
one, and preferably two or more, measurements per period.

## Exercises {#ex:ch:longitudinal}

```{exercise, name = "Potthoff-Roy, wide format imputation", label = "prwide"}
@POTTHOFF1964 published classic data on a study in 16 boys and 11
girls, who at ages 8, 10, 12, and 14 had the distance (mm) from the
center of the pituitary gland to the pteryomaxillary fissure measured.
Changes in pituitary-pteryomaxillary distances during growth is
important in orthodontic therapy. The goals of the study were to
describe the distance in boys and girls as simple functions of age,
and then to compare the functions for boys and girls. The data have
been reanalyzed by many authors including @JENNRICH1986,
@LITTLE1987, @PINHEIRO2000, @VERBEKE2000 and @MOLENBERGHS2007.

1. Take the version from @LITTLE1987 in which nine entries have been
   made missing. The missing data have been created such that children
   with a low value at age 8 are more likely to have a missing value at
   age 10. Use `mice()` to impute the missing entries under the normal
   model using $m$ = 100.

2. For each missing entry, summarize the distribution of the 100
   imputations. Determine the interquartile range of each distribution.
   If the imputations fit the data, how many of the original values you
   expect to fall within this range? How many actually do?

3. Produce a `lattice` graph of the nine imputed trajectories that 
  clearly shows the range of the imputed values.
```

```{exercise, name = "Potthoff-Roy, comparison", label = "prcomparison"}
Use the multiply imputed data from the previous exercise, and apply a
linear mixed effects model with an unstructured mean and an
unstructured covariance. See @MOLENBERGHS2007 [ch. 5] for a
discussion of the setup. Discuss advantages and disadvantages of the
analysis of the multiply imputed data compared to direct likelihood.
```

```{exercise, name = "Potthoff-Roy, long format imputation", label = "prlong"}
Do this exercise with the complete Potthoff-Roy data. Warning: This
exercise requires good data handling skills and some patience.

1. Calculate the broken stick estimates for each child using 8, 10, 12
   and 14 as the break ages. Make a graph like Figure
   \@ref(fig:tbcplotstick). Each data point has exactly one parameter, 
   so the fit could be perfect in principle. Why doesn’t that happen? 
   Which two children show the largest discrepancies between the data 
   and the model?

2. Compare the age-to-age correlation matrix of the broken stick 
   estimates to the original data. Why are these correlation matrices 
   different?

3. How would you adapt the analysis such that the age-to-age 
   correlation matrix of the broken stick estimates would reproduce
   the age-to-age correlation matrix of the original data. Hint:
   Think of a simpler form of multilevel analysis.

4. Multiply impute the data according to the method used in
   Section \@ref(sec:tbcimpute), and produce a display like Figure
   \@ref(fig:tbcplotimp) for children 1, 7, 20, 21, 22 and 24.

5. Compare the age-to-age correlation matrix from the imputed data 
   to that of the original data. Are these different? How?
   Calculate the correlation matrix after deleting the data from
   the two children who showed the largest discrepancy in the
   broken stick model. Did this help?

6. How would you adapt the imputation method for the longitudinal 
   data so that its correlation matrix is close to that of the 
   original?
