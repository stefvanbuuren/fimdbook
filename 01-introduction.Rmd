## The problem of missing data {#sec:problem}

### Current practice {#sec:current}

The mean of the numbers 1, 2 and 4 can be calculated in `R` as

```{r mean1}
```

where `y` is a vector containing three numbers, and where `mean(y)` is the
`R` expression that returns their mean. Now suppose that the last
number is missing. `R` indicates this by the symbol `NA`, which stands
for “not available”:

```{r mean2}
```

The mean is now undefined, and
`R` informs us about this outcome
by setting the mean to `NA`. It is possible to
add an extra argument `na.rm = TRUE` to the
function call. This removes any missing data before calculating the
mean:

```{r mean3}
```

This makes it possible to calculate a result, but of course the set of
observations on which the calculations are based has changed. This may
cause problems in statistical inference and interpretation.

It gets worse with multivariate analysis. For example, let us try to
predict daily ozone concentration (ppb) from wind speed (mph) using the
built-in `airquality` dataset. We fit a linear
regression model by calling the `lm()`
function to predict daily ozone levels, as follows:

```{r air2}
```

Many `R` users have seen this
message. The code cannot continue because there are missing values. One
way to circumvent the problem is to omit any incomplete records by
specifying the `na.action = na.omit` argument
to `lm()`. The regression weights can now be
obtained as

```{r air3}
```

This works. For example, we may produce diagnostic plots by
`plot(fit)` to study the quality of the model. In practice, 
it is cumbersome to supply the `na.action()` function each 
time. We can change the setting in `options` as

```{r air3b}
```

which eliminates the error message once and for all. Users of other
software packages like `SPSS`, `SAS` and `Stata` enjoy the “luxury” that
this deletion option has already been set for them, so the calculations
can progress silently. Next, we wish to plot the predicted ozone levels
against the observed data, so we use `predict()` to calculate the 
predicted values, and add these to the data to prepare for plotting.

```{r air4}
```

Argg... that doesn’t work either. The error message tells us that the
two datasets have a different number of rows. The `airquality` data has 
153 rows, whereas there are only 116 predicted values. The problem, 
of course, is that there are missing data. The `lm()` function dropped any
incomplete rows in the data. We find the indices of the first six cases by

```{r air5}
```

The total number of deleted cases is found as

```{r air6}
```

The number of missing values per variable in the data is

```{r air7}
```

so in our regression model, all 37 deleted cases have missing ozone
scores.

Removing the incomplete cases prior to analysis is known as 
*listwise deletion* or *complete-case analysis*. In `R`, there are 
two related functions for the subset of complete cases, `na.omit()` 
and `complete.cases()`.

Figure \@ref(fig:plotair9) plots the predicted against the observed values.
Here we adopt the Abayomi convention for the colors [@ABAYOMI2008]:
Blue refers to the observed part of the data, red to the
synthetic part of the data (also called the *imputed values* or
*imputations*), and black to the combined data (also called the *imputed data* 
or *completed data*). The printed version of the first edition of
this book used gray instead of blue. The blue points on the left are all
from the complete cases, whereas the figure on the right plots the
points for the incomplete cases (in red). Since there are no measured
ozone levels in that part of the data, the possible values are indicated
by 37 horizontal lines.

```{r air8}
```

```{r plotair9, echo=FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5, duo = TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:plotair9)'}
```
(ref:plotair9) Predicted versus measured ozone levels for the observed (left, blue) and missing values (right, red).

Listwise deletion allows the calculations to proceed, but it may
introduce additional complexities in interpretation. Let’s try to find a
better predictive model by including solar radiation
(`Solar.R`) into the model as

```{r airx6}
```

Observe that the number of deleted days increased is now 42 since some
rows had no value for `Solar.R`. Thus,
changing the model altered the sample.

There are methodological and statistical issues associated with this
procedure. Some questions that come to mind are:

-   Can we compare the regression coefficients from both
    models?

-   Should we attribute differences in the coefficients to changes
    in the model or to changes in the subsample?

-   Do the estimated coefficients generalize to the study
    population?

-   Do we have enough cases to detect the effect of
    interest?

-   Are we making the best use of the costly collected
    data?

Getting the software to run is one thing, but this alone does not
address the challenges posed by the missing data. Unless the analyst, or
the software vendor, provides some way to work around the missing
values, the analysis cannot continue because calculations on missing
values are not possible. There are many approaches to circumvent this
problem. Each of these affects the end result in a different way. Some
solutions are clearly better than others, and there is no solution that
will always work. This chapter reviews the major approaches, and
discusses their advantages and limitations.

### Changing perspective on missing data {#sec:changingperspective}

The standard approach to missing data is to delete them. It is
illustrative to search for missing values in published data. @HAND1994
published a highly useful collection of small datasets across the
statistical literature. The collection covers an impressive variety of
topics. Only 13 out of the 510 datasets in the collection actually had a
code for the missing data. In many cases, the missing data problem has
probably been “solved” in some way, usually without telling us how many
missing values there were originally. It is impossible to track down the
original data for most datasets in Hand’s book. However, we can easily
do this for dataset number 357, a list of scores of 34 athletes in 10
sport events at the 1988 Olympic decathlon in Seoul. The table itself is
complete, but a quick search on the Internet revealed that initially 39
instead of 34 athletes participated. Five of them did not finish for
various reasons, including the dramatic disqualification of the German
favorite Jürgen Hingsen because of three false starts in the 100-meter
sprint. It is probably fair to assume that deletion occurred silently in
many of the other datasets.

The inclination to delete the missing data is understandable. Apart from
the technical difficulties imposed by the missing data, the occurrence
of missing data has long been considered a sign of sloppy research. It
is all too easy for a referee to write:

> This study is weak because of the large amount of missing data.

Publication chances are likely to improve if there is no hint of
missingness. @ORCHARD1972 [p. 697] remarked:

> Obviously the best way to treat missing data is not to have them.

Though there is a lot of truth in this statement, Orchard
and Woodbury realized the impossibility of attaining this ideal in
practice. The prevailing scientific practice is to downplay the missing
data. Reviews on reporting practices are available in various fields:
clinical trials [@WOOD2004; @POWNEY2014; @DIAZ2014; @AKL2015], cancer
research [@BURTON2004], educational research [@PEUGH2004], epidemiology
[@KLEBANOFF2008; @KARAHALIOS2012], developmental psychology
[@JELICIC2009], general medicine [@MACKINNON2010], developmental
pediatrics [@AYLWARD2010], and otorhinolaryngology, head and neck
surgery [@NETTEN2017]. The picture that emerges from these studies is
quite consistent:

-   The presence of missing data is often not explicitly stated in
    the text;

-   Default methods, such as listwise deletion are used without
    mentioning them;

-   Different tables are based on different sample sizes;

-   Model-based missing data methods, such as direct likelihood,
    full information maximum likelihood and multiple imputation, are
    notably underutilized.

Helpful resources include the STROBE [@VANDENBROUCKE2007] and CONSORT
checklists and flow charts [@SCHULZ2010]. @GOMES2016 showed cases where
the subset of full patient-reported outcomes is a selective, leading to
misleading results. @PALMER2017 suggested a classification scheme for
the reasons of nonresponse in patient-reported outcomes.

Missing data are there, whether we like it or not. In the social
sciences, it is nearly inevitable that some respondents will refuse to
participate or to answer certain questions. In medical studies,
attrition of patients is very common. The theory, methodology and
software for handling incomplete data problems have been vastly expanded
and refined over the last decades. The major statistical analysis
packages now have facilities for performing the appropriate analyses.
This book aims to contribute to a better understanding of the issues
involved, and provides a methodology for dealing with incomplete data
problems in practice.

## Concepts of MCAR, MAR and MNAR {#sec:MCAR}

Before we review a number of simple fixes for the missing data in
Section \@ref(sec:simplesolutions) let us take a short look at the terms
MCAR, MAR and MNAR. A more detailed definition of these concepts will be
given later in Section \@ref(sec:notation). @RUBIN1976 classified missing
data problems into three categories. In his theory every data point has
some likelihood of being missing. The process that governs these
probabilities is called the *missing data mechanism* or
*response mechanism*. The model for the process is called
the *missing data model* or *response model*.

If the probability of being missing is the same for all cases, then the
data are said to be missing completely at random (MCAR). This
effectively implies that causes of the missing data are unrelated to the
data. We may consequently ignore many of the complexities that arise
because data are missing, apart from the obvious loss of information. An
example of MCAR is a weighing scale that ran out of batteries. Some of
the data will be missing simply because of bad luck. Another example is
when we take a random sample of a population, where each member has the
same chance of being included in the sample. The (unobserved) data of
members in the population that were not included in the sample are MCAR.
While convenient, MCAR is often unrealistic for the data at hand.

If the probability of being missing is the same only within groups
defined by the *observed* data, then the data are missing at random
(MAR). MAR is a much broader class than MCAR. For example, when placed
on a soft surface, a weighing scale may produce more missing values than
when placed on a hard surface. Such data are thus not MCAR. If, however,
we know surface type and if we can assume MCAR *within* the type of
surface, then the data are MAR. Another example of MAR is when we take a
sample from a population, where the probability to be included depends
on some known property. MAR is more general and more realistic than
MCAR. Modern missing data methods generally start from the MAR
assumption.

If neither MCAR nor MAR holds, then we speak of missing not at random
(MNAR). In the literature one can also find the term NMAR (not missing
at random) for the same concept. MNAR means that the probability of
being missing varies for reasons that are unknown to us. For example,
the weighing scale mechanism may wear out over time, producing more
missing data as time progresses, but we may fail to note this. If the
heavier objects are measured later in time, then we obtain a
distribution of the measurements that will be distorted. MNAR includes
the possibility that the scale produces more missing values for the
heavier objects (as above), a situation that might be difficult to
recognize and handle. An example of MNAR in public opinion research
occurs if those with weaker opinions respond less often. MNAR is the
most complex case. Strategies to handle MNAR are to find more data about
the causes for the missingness, or to perform what-if analyses to see
how sensitive the results are under various scenarios.

Rubin’s distinction is important for understanding why some methods will
work, and others not. His theory lays down the conditions under which a
missing data method can provide valid statistical inferences. Most
simple fixes only work under the restrictive and often unrealistic MCAR
assumption. If MCAR is implausible, such methods can provide biased
estimates.

## Ad-hoc solutions {#sec:simplesolutions}

### Listwise deletion {#sec:listwise}

Complete-case analysis (listwise deletion) is the default way of
handling incomplete data in many statistical packages, including
`SPSS`, `SAS` and `Stata`. The function `na.omit()` does the same in
`S-PLUS` and `R`. The procedure eliminates all
cases with one or more missing values on the analysis variables. An
important advantage of complete-case analysis is convenience. If the
data are MCAR, listwise deletion produces unbiased estimates of means,
variances and regression weights. Under MCAR, listwise deletion produces
standard errors and significance levels that are correct for the reduced
subset of data, but that are often larger relative to all available
data.

A disadvantage of listwise deletion is that it is potentially wasteful.
It is not uncommon in real life applications that more than half of the
original sample is lost, especially if the number of variables is large.
@KING2001 estimated that the percentage of incomplete records in the
political sciences exceeded 50% on average, with some studies having
over 90% incomplete records. It will be clear that a smaller subsample
could seriously degrade the ability to detect the effects of interest.

If the data are not MCAR, listwise deletion can severely bias estimates
of means, regression coefficients and correlations. @LITTLE2002 [pp.
41–44] showed that the bias in the estimated mean increases with the
difference between means of the observed and missing cases, and with the
proportion of the missing data. @SCHAFER2002 reported an elegant
simulation study that demonstrates the bias of listwise deletion under
MAR and MNAR. However, complete-case analysis is not always bad. The
implications of the missing data are different depending on where they
occur (outcomes or predictors), and the parameter and model form of the
complete-data model. In the context of regression analysis, listwise
deletion possesses some unique properties that make it attractive in
particular settings. There are cases in which listwise deletion can
provide better estimates than even the most sophisticated procedures.
Since their discussion requires a bit more background than can be given
here, we defer the treatment to Section \@ref(sec:when).

Listwise deletion can introduce inconsistencies in reporting. Since
listwise deletion is automatically applied to the active set of
variables, different analyses on the same data are often based on
different subsamples. In principle, it is possible to produce one global
subsample using all active variables. In practice, this is unattractive
since the global subsample will always have fewer cases than each of the
local subsamples, so it is common to create different subsets for
different tables. It will be evident that this complicates their
comparison and generalization to the study population.

In some cases, listwise deletion can lead to nonsensical subsamples. For
example, the rows in the `airquality` dataset
used in Section \@ref(sec:current) correspond to 154 consecutive days
between May 1, 1973 and September 30, 1973. Deleting days affects the
time basis. It would be much harder, if not impossible, to perform
analyses that involve time, e.g., to identify weekly patterns or to fit
autoregressive models that predict from previous days.

The opinions on the merits of listwise deletion vary. @MIETTINEN1985 [p.
231] described listwise deletion as

> …the only approach that assures that no bias is introduced under any
> circumstances…

a bold statement, but incorrect. At the other end of the spectrum we
find @ENDERS2010 [p. 39]:

> In most situations, the disadvantages of listwise deletion far
> outweigh its advantages.

@SCHAFER2002 [p. 156] cover the middle ground:

> If a missing data problem can be resolved by discarding only a small
> part of the sample, then the method can be quite effective.

The leading authors in the field are, however, wary of providing advice
about the percentage of missing cases below which it is still acceptable
to do listwise deletion. @LITTLE2002 argue that it is difficult to
formulate rules of thumb since the consequences of using listwise
deletion depend on more than the missing data rate alone. @VACH1994 [p.
113] expressed his dislike for simplistic rules as follows:

> It is often supposed that there exists something like a critical
> missing rate up to which missing values are not too dangerous. The
> belief in such a global missing rate is rather stupid.

### Pairwise deletion {#sec:pairwise}

*Pairwise deletion*, also known as *available-case analysis*, attempts
to remedy the data loss problem of listwise deletion. The method
calculates the means and (co)variances on all observed data. Thus, the
mean of variable $X$ is based on all cases with observed data on $X$,
the mean of variable $Y$ uses all cases with observed $Y$-values, and so
on. For the correlation and covariance, all data are taken on which both
$X$ and $Y$ have non-missing scores. Subsequently, the matrix of summary
statistics are fed into a program for regression analysis, factor
analysis or other modeling procedures.

`SPSS`, `SAS` and `Stata` contain many procedures with an option for
pairwise deletion. In `R` we can calculate the means and correlations
of the `airquality` data under pairwise deletion in `R` as:

```{r pairwise1, eval = FALSE}
```

The standard `lm()` function does not take means and covariances as
input, but the `lavaan` package [@ROSSEEL2012] provides this feature:

```{r pairwise2, eval = FALSE}
```

The method is simple, and appears to use all available information.
Under MCAR, it produces consistent estimates of mean, correlations and
covariances [@LITTLE2002 p. 55]. The method has also some shortcomings.
First, the estimates can be biased if the data are not MCAR. Further,
the covariance and/or correlation matrix may not be positive definite,
which is requirement for most multivariate procedures. Problems are
generally more severe for highly correlated variables [@LITTLE1992]. It
is not clear what sample size should be used for calculating standard
errors. Taking the average sample size yields standard errors that are
too small[@LITTLE1992]. Also, pairwise deletion requires numerical data
that follow an approximate normal distribution, whereas in practice we
often have variables of mixed types.

The idea to use all available information is good, but the proper
analysis of the pairwise matrix requires sophisticated optimization
techniques and special formulas to calculate the standard errors
[@VANPRAAG1985; @MARSH1998], which somewhat defeats its utility.
Pairwise deletion works best used if the data approximate a multivariate
normal distribution, if the correlations between the variables are low,
and if the assumption of MCAR is plausible. It is not recommended for
other cases.

### Mean imputation {#sec:meanimp}

A quick fix for the missing data is to replace them by the mean. We may
use the mode for categorical data. Suppose we want to impute the mean in
`Ozone` and `Solar.R` of the `airquality` data. `SPSS`, `SAS` and `Stata`
have pre-built functions that substitute the mean. This book uses the
`R` package `mice` [@VANBUUREN2011B]. This software is a contributed
package that extends the functionality of `R`. Before `mice` can be
used, it must be installed. An easy way to do this is to type:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
```

which searches the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and installs
the requested package on the local computer. After succesful
installation, the `mice` package can be loaded by

```{r load, eval = FALSE}
```

Imputing the mean in each variable can now be done by

```{r meanimp}
```

The argument `method = mean` specifies mean imputation, the argument
`m = 1` requests a single imputed dataset, and `maxit = 1` sets
the number of iterations to 1 (no iteration). The latter two options can
be left to their defaults with essentially the same result.

```{r plotmeanimp, duo = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = '(ref:plotmeanimp)'}
```
(ref:plotmeanimp) Mean imputation of `Ozone`. Blue indicates the observed data, red indicates the imputed values.

Mean imputation distorts the distribution in several ways. Figure
\@ref(fig:plotmeanimp) displays the distribution of
`Ozone` after imputation. In the figure on the
left, the red bar at the mean stands out. Imputing the mean here
actually creates a bimodal distribution. The standard deviation in the
imputed data is equal to 28.7, much smaller than from the observed data
alone, which is 33. The figure on the right-hand side shows that the
relation between `Ozone` and `Solar.R` is distorted because of the
imputations. The correlation drops from 0.35 in the blue points
to 0.3 in the combined data.

Mean imputation is a fast and simple fix for the missing data. However,
it will underestimate the variance, disturb the relations between
variables, bias almost any estimate other than the mean and bias the
estimate of the mean when data are not MCAR. Mean imputation should
perhaps only be used as a rapid fix when a handful of values are
missing, and it should be avoided in general.

### Regression imputation {#sec:regimp}

Regression imputation incorporates knowledge of other variables with the
idea of producing smarter imputations. The first step involves building
a model from the observed data. Predictions for the incomplete cases are
then calculated under the fitted model, and serve as replacements for
the missing data. Suppose that we predict `Ozone` by linear regression
from `Solar.R`.

```{r regimp}
```

```{r plotregimp, duo = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.asp=0.5, fig.cap = '(ref:plotregimp)'}
```
(ref:plotregimp) Regression imputation: Imputing `Ozone` from the regression line.

Another possibility for regression imputation uses `mice`:

```{r regimp2, eval = FALSE}
```

Figure \@ref(fig:plotregimp) shows the result. The imputed values correspond to
the most likely values under the model. However, the ensemble of imputed
values vary less than the observed values. It may be that each of the
individual points is the best under the model, but it is very unlikely
that the real (but unobserved) values of `Ozone` would have had this distribution.
Imputing predicted values also has an effect on the correlation. The red
points have a correlation of 1 since they are located on a line. If the
red and blue dots are combined, then the correlation
increases from 0.35 to 0.39. Note that this upward bias grows with the
percent missing ozone levels (here 24%).

Regression imputation yields unbiased estimates of the means under MCAR,
just like mean imputation, and of the regression weights of the
imputation model if the explanatory variables are complete. Moreover,
the regression weights are unbiased under MAR if the factors that
influence the missingness are part of the regression model. In the
example this corresponds to the situation where `Solar.R` would explain
any differences in the probability that `Ozone` is missing. On the
other hand, correlations are biased upwards, and the variability of the
imputed data is systematically underestimated. The degree of
underestimation depends on the explained variance and on the proportion
of missing cases [@LITTLE2002 p. 64].

Imputing predicted values can yield realistic imputations if the
prediction is close to perfection. If so, the method reconstructs the
missing parts from the available data. In essence, there was not really
any information missing in the first place, it was only coded in a
different form.

Regression imputation, as well as its modern incarnations in machine
learning is probably the most dangerous of all methods described here.
We may be led to believe that we’re to do a good job by preserving the
relations between the variables. In reality however, regression
imputation artificially strengthens the relations in the data.
Correlations are biased upwards. Variability is underestimated.
Imputations are too good to be true. Regression imputation is a recipe
for false positive and spurious relations.

### Stochastic regression imputation {#sec:sri}

Stochastic regression imputation is a refinement of regression
imputation attempts to address correlation bias by adding noise to the
predictions. The following code imputes `Ozone` from `Solar.R` by
stochastic regression imputation.

```{r sri}
```
```{r plotsri, duo = TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5, fig.cap = '(ref:plotsri)'}
```
(ref:plotsri) Stochastic regression imputation of `Ozone`.

The `method = norm.nob` argument requests a plain, non-Bayesian,
stochastic regression method. This method first
estimates the intercept, slope and residual variance under the linear
model, then calculates the predicted value for each missing value, and
adds a random draw from the residual to the prediction. We will come
back to the details in Section \@ref(sec:linearnormal). The
`seed` argument makes the solution reproducible. Figure \@ref(fig:plotsri)
shows that the addition of noise to the predictions opens up the
distribution of the imputed values, as intended.

Note that some new complexities arise. There is one imputation with a
negative value. Such values need not be due to the draws from the
residual distribution, but can also be a consequence of the use of a
linear model for non-negative data. In fact, Figure \@ref(fig:plotair9) shows
several negative predicted values in the observed data. Since negative
`Ozone` concentrations do not exist in the real world, we cannot
consider negative values as plausible imputations.
Note also that the high end of the distribution is not well covered. The
observed data form a cone, i.e., the data are heteroscedastic, but the
imputation model assumes equal dispersion around the regression line.
The variability of `Ozone` increases up to the
solar radiation level of 250 langleys, and decreases after that. Though
it is unclear whether this is a genuine meteorological phenomenon, the
imputation model does not account for this feature.

Nevertheless, stochastic regression imputation represents a major
conceptual advance. Some analysts may find it counterintuitive to
“spoil” the best prediction by adding random noise, yet this is
precisely what makes it suitable for imputation. A well-executed
stochastic regression imputation preserves not only the regression
weights, but also the correlation between variables (cf. Exercise
\@ref(exr:sriexr)). The main idea to draw from the residuals is very 
powerful, and forms the basis of more advanced imputation techniques.

### LOCF and BOCF {#sec:locf}

Last observation carried forward (LOCF) and baseline observation carried
forward (BOCF) are ad-hoc imputation methods for longitudinal data. The
idea is to take the previous observed value as a replacement for the
missing data. When multiple values are missing in succession, the method
searches for the last observed value.

The function `fill()` from the `tidyr` package applies LOCF by filling in the
last known value. This is useful in situations where values are recorded
only as they change, as in time-to-event data. For example, we may use
LOCF to fill in `Ozone` by

```{r locf1}
```

```{r locf2,echo=FALSE,fig.asp = 0.556, solo=TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:locf2)'}
lwd <- 0.6
Oz <- airquality$Oz
Ozi <- airquality2$Oz
colvec <- ifelse(is.na(Oz), mdc(2), mdc(1))
plot(Ozi[1:80], col = colvec, type = "l",
     xlab = "Day number", ylab = "Ozone (ppb)",
     lwd = lwd, axes = FALSE)
points(Ozi[1:80], col = colvec, pch = 20)
axis(1, lwd = lwd)
axis(2, lwd = lwd, las = 1)
box(lwd = lwd)
```
(ref:locf2) Imputation of `Ozone` by last observation carried forward (LOCF).

Figure \@ref(fig:locf2) plots the results of the first 80 days of the
`Ozone` series. The stretches of red dots
indicate the imputations, and are constant within the same batch of
missing ozone levels. The real, unseen values are likely to vary within
these batches, so applying LOCF here gives implausible imputations.

LOCF is convenient because it generates a complete dataset. It can be
applied with confidence in cases where we are certain what the missing
values should be, for example, for administrative variables in
longitudinal data. For outcomes, LOCF is dubious. The method has long
been used in clinical trials. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has traditionally viewed LOCF as the preferred method of analysis,
considering it conservative and less prone to selection than listwise
deletion. However, @MOLENBERGHS2007 [pp. 47–50] show that the bias can
operate in both directions, and that LOCF can yield biased estimates
even under MCAR. LOCF needs to be followed by a proper statistical
analysis method that distinguishes between the real and imputed data.
This is typically not done however. Additional concerns about a reversal
of the time direction are given in @KENWARD2009.

The Panel on Handling Missing Data in Clinical Trials recommends that
LOCF and BOCF should not be used as the primary approach for handling
missing data unless the assumptions that underlie them are
scientifically justified [@NRC2010 p. 77].

### Indicator method {#sec:indicator}

Suppose that we want to fit a regression, but there are missing values
in one of the explanatory variables. The indicator method
[@MIETTINEN1985 p. 232] replaces each missing value by a zero and
extends the regression model by the response indicator. The procedure is
applied to each incomplete variable. The user analyzes the extended
model instead of the original.

In `R` the indicator method can be coded as

```{r indicator1}
```

Observe that since the missing data are in `Ozone` we needed to
reverse the direction of the regression model.

The indicator method has been popular in public health and epidemiology.
An advantage is that the indicator method retains the full dataset.
Also, it allows for systematic differences between the observed and the
unobserved data by inclusion of the response indicator, and could be
more efficient. @WHITE2005 pointed out that the method can be useful to
estimate the treatment effect in randomized trials when a baseline
covariate is partially observed. If the missing data are restricted to
the covariate, if the interest is solely restricted to estimation of the
treatment effect, if compliance to the allocated treatment is perfect
and if the model is linear without interactions, then using the
indicator method for that covariate yields an unbiased estimate of the
treatment effect. This is true even if the missingness depends on the
covariate itself. Additional work can be found in @GROENWOLD2012
[@SULLIVAN2016]. It is not yet clear whether the coverage of the
confidence interval around the treatment estimate will be satisfactory
for multiple incomplete baseline covariates.

The conditions under which the indicator method works may not be met in
practice. For example, the method does not allow for missing data in the
outcome, and generally fails in observational data. It has been shown
that the method can yield severely biased regression estimates, even
under MCAR and for low amounts of missing data
[@VACH1991; @GREENLAND1995; @KNOL2010]. The indicator method may have
its uses in particular situations, but fails as a generic method to
handle missing data.

  : (\#tab:simple) Overview of assumptions made by ad-hoc methods.

Table \@ref(tab:simple) provides a summary of the methods discussed in this
section. The table addresses two topics: whether the method yields the
correct results on average (unbiasedness), and whether it produces the
correct standard error. Unbiasedness is evaluated with respect to three
types of estimates: the mean, the regression weight (with the incomplete
variable as dependent) and the correlation.

The table identifies the assumptions on the missing data mechanism each
method must make in order to produce unbiased estimates. The first line
of the table should be read as follows:

1.  *Listwise deletion* produces an unbiased estimate of the
    *mean* provided that the data are *MCAR*;

2.  *Listwise deletion* produces an estimate of the standard error
    that is *too large*.

The interpretation of the other lines is similar. The “–” sign in some
cells indicates that the method cannot produce unbiased estimates.
Observe that both deletion methods require MCAR for all types.
Regression imputation and stochastic regression imputation can yield
unbiased estimates under MAR. In order to work, the model needs to be
correctly specified. LOCF and the indicator method are incapable of
providing consistent estimates, even under MCAR. Note that some special
cases are not covered in Table \@ref(tab:simple). For example, listwise
deletion is unbiased under two special MNAR scenarios (cf. Section
\@ref(sec:when)).

Listwise deletion produces standard errors that are correct for the
subset of complete cases, but in general too large for the entire
dataset. Calculation of standard errors under pairwise deletion is
complicated. The standard errors after single imputation are too small
since the standard calculations make no distinction between the observed
data and the imputed data. Correction factors for some situations have
been developed [@SCHAFER2000], but a more convenient solution is
multiple imputation.

## Multiple imputation in a nutshell {#sec:nutshell}

### Procedure

Multiple imputation creates $m>1$ complete datasets. Each of these
datasets is analyzed by standard analysis software. The $m$ results are
pooled into a final point estimate plus standard error by pooling rules
(“Rubin’s rules”). Figure \@ref(fig:miflow) illustrates the three main
steps in multiple imputation: imputation, analysis and pooling.

```{r miflow, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:miflow)', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/ch01-miflow-1.png")
```
(ref:miflow) Scheme of main steps in multiple imputation.

The analysis starts with observed, incomplete data. Multiple imputation
creates several complete versions of the data by replacing the missing
values by plausible data values. These plausible values are drawn from a
distribution specifically modeled for each missing entry. Figure
\@ref(fig:miflow) portrays $m=3$ imputed datasets. In practice, $m$ is
often taken larger (cf. Section \@ref(sec:howmany)). The number $m=3$ is
taken here just to make the point that the technique creates multiple
versions of the imputed data. The three imputed datasets are identical
for the observed data entries, but differ in the imputed values. The
magnitude of these difference reflects our uncertainty about what value
to impute.

The second step is to estimate the parameters of interest from each
imputed dataset. This is typically done by applying the analytic method
that we would have used had the data been complete. The results will
differ because their input data differ. It is important to realize that
these differences are caused only because of the uncertainty about what
value to impute.

The last step is to pool the $m$ parameter estimates into one estimate,
and to estimate its variance. The variance combines the conventional
sampling variance (within-imputation variance) and the extra variance
caused by the missing data extra variance caused by the missing data
(between-imputation variance). Under the appropriate conditions, the
pooled estimates are unbiased and have the correct statistical
properties.

### Reasons to use multiple imputation

Multiple imputation [@RUBIN1987; @RUBIN1996] solves the problem of “too
small” standard errors in Table \@ref(tab:simple). Multiple imputation is
unique in the sense that it provides a mechanism for dealing with the
inherent uncertainty of the imputations themselves.

Our level of confidence in a particular imputed value is expressed as
the variation across the $m$ completed datasets. For example, in a
disability survey, suppose that the respondent answered the item whether
he could walk, but did not provide an answer to the item whether he
could get up from a chair. If the person can walk, then it is highly
likely that the person will also be able to get up from the chair. Thus,
for persons who can walk, we can draw a “yes” for missing “getting up
from a chair” with a high probability, say 0.99, and use the drawn value
as the imputed value. In the extreme, if we are really certain, we
always impute the same value for that person. In general however, we are
less confident about the true value. Suppose that, in a growth study,
height is missing for a subject. If we only know that this person is a
woman, this provides some information about likely values, but not so
much. So the range of plausible values from which we draw is much larger
here. The imputations for this woman will thus vary a lot over the
different datasets. Multiple imputation is able to deal with both
high-confidence and low-confidence situations equally well.

Another reason to use multiple imputation is that it separates the
solution of the missing data problem from the solution of the
complete-data problem. The missing-data problem is solved first, the
complete-data problem next. Though these phases are not completely
independent, the answer to the scientifically interesting question is
not obscured anymore by the missing data. The ability to separate the
two phases simplifies statistical modeling, and hence contributes to a
better insight into the phenomenon of scientific study.

### Example of multiple imputation {#sec:miexample}

Continuing with the `airquality` dataset, it is straightforward to 
apply multiple imputation. The following code imputes the missing 
data twenty times, fits a linear regression model to predict `Ozone` 
in each of the imputed datasets, pools the twenty sets of estimated 
parameters, and calculates the Wald statistics for testing 
significance of the weights.

```{r airx8}
```

There is much more to say about each of these steps, but it shows that
multiple imputation need not be a daunting task. Assuming we have set
`options(na.action = na.omit)`, fitting the same model to the complete 
cases can be done by

```{r airx9}
```

The solutions are nearly identical here, which is due to the fact that
most missing values occur in the outcome variable. The standard errors
of the multiple imputation solution are slightly smaller than in the
complete-case analysis. Multiple imputation is often more efficient than
complete-case analysis. Depending on the data and the model at hand, the
differences can be dramatic.

```{r plotairmi, echo=FALSE, fig.asp = 0.5, duo = TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:plotairmi)'}
```
(ref:plotairmi) Multiple imputation of `Ozone`. Plotted are the imputed values from the first imputation.

Figure \@ref(fig:plotairmi) shows the distribution and scattergram for the
observed and imputed data combined. The imputations are taken from the
first completed dataset. The blue and red distributions are
quite similar. Problems with the negative values as in Figure
\@ref(fig:plotsri) are now gone since the imputation method used observed data
as donors to fill the missing data. Section \@ref(sec:pmm) describes the
method in detail. Note that the red points respect the heteroscedastic
nature of the relation between `Ozone` and `Solar.R`. All in all, the red 
points look as if they could have been measured if they had not been 
missing. The reader can easily recalculate the solution and inspect these 
plots for the other imputations.

```{r air10, echo=FALSE,fig.asp = 0.556, solo=TRUE, fig.cap = '(ref:air10)'}
Oz <- airquality$Ozone
colvec <- ifelse(is.na(Oz),mdc(2),mdc(1))

plot(Oz[1:80],col=mdc(1),type="l",xlab="Day number",ylab="Ozone (ppb)",
     axes = FALSE,lwd = lwd)
points(Oz[1:80],col=mdc(1),pch=20)
lwd <- 0.6
axis(1, lwd = lwd)
axis(2, lwd = lwd, las = 1)
box(lwd = lwd)

idx <- ici(airquality$Ozone) & (1:153)<81
x   <- (1:153)[idx]
points(x=x,y=complete(imp,1)$Ozone[idx],col=mdc(2),lwd=lwd,pch=20,cex=1)
points(x=x,y=complete(imp,2)$Ozone[idx],col=mdc(2),lwd=lwd,pch=20,cex=1)
points(x=x,y=complete(imp,3)$Ozone[idx],col=mdc(2),lwd=lwd,pch=20,cex=1)
points(x=x,y=complete(imp,4)$Ozone[idx],col=mdc(2),lwd=lwd,pch=20,cex=1)
points(x=x,y=complete(imp,5)$Ozone[idx],col=mdc(2),lwd=lwd,pch=20,cex=1)
```
(ref:air10) Multiple imputation of `Ozone`. Plotted are the observed values (in blue) and the multiply imputed values (in red).

Figure \@ref(fig:air10) plots the completed `Ozone` data. The
imputed data of all five imputations are plotted for the days with
missing `Ozone` scores. In order to avoid clutter, the
lines that connect the dots are not drawn for the imputed values. Note
that the pattern of imputed values varies substantially over the days.
At the beginning of the series, the values are low and the spread is
small, in particular for the cold and windy days 25–27. The small spread
for days 25–27 indicates that the model is quite sure of these values.
High imputed values are found around the hot and sunny days 35–42,
whereas the imputations during the moderate days 52–61 are consistently
in the moderate range. Note how the available information helps
determine sensible imputed values that respect the relations between
wind, temperature, sunshine and ozone.

One final point. The `airquality` data is a
time series of 153 days. It is well known that the standard error of the
ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate is inefficient (too large) if the
residuals have positive serial correlation [@HARVEY1981]. The first
three autocorrelations of the `Ozone` are
indeed large: 0.48, 0.31 and 0.29. The residual autocorrelations are
however small and within the confidence interval: 0.13, $-0.02$ and
0.04. The inefficiency of OLS is thus negligible here.

## Goal of the book {#sec:goal}

The main goal of this book is to add multiple imputation to the tool
chest of practitioners. The text explains the ideas underlying multiple
imputation, discusses when multiple imputation is useful, how to do it
in practice and how to report the results of the steps taken.

The computations are done with the help of the `R` package `mice`,
written by Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn and myself [@VANBUUREN2011B]. The
book thus also serves as an extended tutorial on the practical
application of `mice`. Online materials that accompany the book
can be found on www.multiple-imputation.com. My hope
is that this hands-on approach will facilitate understanding of the key
ideas in multiple imputation.

## What the book does not cover {#sec:doesnotcover}

The field of missing data research is vast. This book focuses on
multiple imputation. The book does not attempt cover the enormous body
of literature on alternative approaches to incomplete data. This section
briefly reviews three of these approaches.

### Prevention {#sec:prevention}

With the exception of @MCKNIGHT2007 [Chapter 4], books on missing data
do not mention prevention. Yet, prevention of the missing data is the
most direct attack on problems caused by the missing data. Prevention is
fully in spirit with the quote of Orchard and Woodbury given on p. .
There is a lot one could do to prevent missing data. The remainder of
this section lists point-wise advice.

Minimize the use of intrusive measures, like blood samples. Visit the
subject at home. Use incentives to stimulate response, and try to match
up the interviewer and respondent on age and ethnicity. Adapt the mode
of the study (telephone, face to face, web questionnaire, and so on) to
the study population. Use a multi-mode design for different groups in
your study. Quickly follow-up for people that do not respond, and where
possible try to retrieve any missing data from other sources.

In experimental studies, try to minimize the treatment burden and
intensity where possible. Prepare a well-thought-out flyer that explains
the purpose and usefulness of your study. Try to organize data
collection through an authority, e.g., the patient’s own doctor. Conduct
a pilot study to detect and smooth out any problems.

Economize on the number of variables collected. Only collect the
information that is absolutely essential to your study. Use short forms
of measurement instruments where possible. Eliminate vague or ambivalent
questionnaire items. Use an attractive layout of the instruments.
Refrain from using blocks of items that force the respondent to stay on
a particular page for a long time. Use computerized adaptive testing
where feasible. Do not allow other studies to piggy-back on your data
collection efforts.

Do not overdo it. Many Internet questionnaires are annoying because they
force the respondent to answer. Do not force your respondent. The result
will be an apparently complete dataset with mediocre data. Respect the
wish of your respondent to skip items. The end result will be more
informative.

Use double coding in the data entry, and chase up any differences
between the versions. Devise nonresponse forms in which you try to find
out why people they did not respond, or why they dropped out.

Last but not least, consult experts. Many academic centers have
departments that specialize in research methodology. Sound expert advice
may turn out to be extremely valuable for keeping your missing data rate
under control.

Most of this advice can be found in books on research methodology and
data quality. Good books are @SHADISH2001, @DELEEUW2008, @DILLMAN2008
and @GROVES2009.

### Weighting procedures {#sec:weighting}

Weighting is a method to reduce bias when the probability to be selected
in the survey differs between respondents. In sample surveys, the
responders are weighted by design weights, which are inversely
proportional to their probability of being selected in the survey. If
there are missing data, the complete cases are re-weighted according to
design weights that are adjusted to counter any selection effects
produced by nonresponse. The method is widely used in official
statistics. Relevant pointers include @COCHRAN1977 and @SARNDAL1992 and
@BETHLEHEM2002.

The method is relatively simple in that only one set of weights is
needed for all incomplete variables. On the other hand, it discards data
by listwise deletion, and it cannot handle partial response. Expressions
for the variance of regression weights or correlations tend to be
complex, or do not exist. The weights are estimated from the data, but
are generally treated as fixed. The implications for this are unclear
[@LITTLE2002 p. 53].

There has been interest recently in improved weighting procedures that
are “double robust” [@SCHARFSTEIN1999; @BANG2005]. This estimation
method requires specification of three models: Model A is the
scientifically interesting model, Model B is the response model for the
outcome, and model C is the joint model for the predictors and the
outcome. The dual robustness property states that: if either Model B or
Model C is wrong (but not both), the estimates under Model A are still
consistent. This seems like a useful property, but the issue is not free
of controversy [@KANG2007].

### Likelihood-based approaches {#sec:likelihood}

Likelihood-based approaches define a model for the observed data. Since
the model is specialized to the observed values, there is no need to
impute missing data or to discard incomplete cases. The inferences are
based on the likelihood or posterior distribution under the posited
model. The parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood, the EM
algorithm, the sweep operator, Newton–Raphson, Bayesian simulation and
variants thereof. These methods are smart ways to skip over the missing
data, and are known as direct likelihood, full information maximum
likelihood (FIML), and more recently, pairwise likelihood estimation.

Likelihood-based methods are, in some sense, the “royal way” to treat
missing data problems. The estimated parameters nicely summarize the
available information under the assumed models for the complete data and
the missing data. The model assumptions can be displayed and evaluated,
and in many cases it is possible to estimate the standard error of the
estimates.

Multiple imputation extends likelihood-based methods by adding an extra
step in which imputed data values are drawn. An advantage of this is
that it is generally easier to calculate the standard errors for a wider
range of parameters. Moreover, the imputed values created by multiple
imputation can be inspected and analyzed, which helps us to gauge the
effect of the model assumptions on the inferences.

The likelihood-based approach receives an excellent treatment in the
book by @LITTLE2002. A less technical account that should appeal to
social scientists can be found in @ENDERS2010 [chapters 3–5].
@MOLENBERGHS2007 provide a hands-on approach of likelihood-based methods
geared toward clinical studies, including extensions to data that are
MNAR. The pairwise likelihood method was introduced by @KATSIKATSOU2012
and has been implemented in `lavaan`.

## Structure of the book {#sec:structure}

This book consists of three main parts: basics, case studies and
extensions. Chapter \@ref(ch:mi) reviews the history of multiple imputation
and introduces the notation and theory. Chapter \@ref(ch:univariate)
provides an overview of imputation methods for univariate missing data.
Chapter \@ref(ch:multivariate) distinguishes three approaches to attack the
problem of multivariate missing data. Chapter \@ref(ch:analysis) reviews
issues pertaining to the analysis of the imputed datasets.

Chapter \@ref(ch:practice) discusses practical issues for multivariate
missing data. Chapter \@ref(ch:multilevel) discusses the problem how to
impute for nested data so as to preserve the multilevel structure.
Chapter \@ref(ch:ice) explores the use of multiple imputation to estimate
individual causal effects.

Chapters \@ref(ch:measurement)–\@ref(ch:longitudinal) contain case studies of
the techniques described in the previous chapters. Chapter
\@ref(ch:measurement) deals with “problems with the columns,” while Chapter
\@ref(ch:selection) addresses “problems with the rows”. Chapter
\@ref(ch:longitudinal) discusses studies on problems with both rows and
columns.

Chapter \@ref(ch:conclusion) concludes the main text with a discussion of
limitations and pitfalls, reporting guidelines, alternative applications
and future extensions.

## Exercises {#ex:ch1}

```{exercise, name = "Reporting practice", label = "report"}
What are the reporting practices in your field? Take a random sample 
of articles that have appeared during the last 10 years in the leading 
journal in your field. Select only those that present quantitative 
analyses, and address the following topics:
  
1. Did the authors report that there were missing data?
  
2. If not, can you infer from the text that there must have
   been missing data?
  
3. Did the authors discuss how they handled the missing
   data?
  
4. Were the missing data properly addressed?
  
5. Can you detect a trend over time in reporting practice?
  
6. Would the editors of the journal be interested in your findings?

```

```{exercise, name = "Loss of information", label = "caseslost"}
Suppose that a dataset consists of 100 cases and 10 variables. 
Each variable contains 10% missing values. What is the 
largest possible subsample under listwise deletion? What
is the smallest? If each variable is MCAR, how many cases will
remain?
```

```{exercise, name = "Stochastic regression imputation", label = "sriexr"}
The correlation of the data in Figure \@ref(fig:plotsri) is 
equal to 0.33. This is relatively low compared to the other 
correlations reported in Section \@ref(sec:simplesolutions). 
This seems to contradict the statement that stochastic regression 
imputation does not bias the correlation. Could this low correlation 
be due to random variation?

1. Rerun the code with a different `seed` value. What is the 
   correlation now?
     
2. Write a loop to apply apply stochastic regression imputation 
   with the `seed` increasing from 1 to 1000. Calculate the 
   regression weight and the correlation for each solution, and 
   plot the histogram. What are the mean, minimum and maximum 
   values of the correlation?
     
3. Do your results indicate that stochastic regression imputation 
   alters the correlation?

```


```{exercise, name = "Stochastic regression imputation (continued)", label = "sricontinued"}
The largest correlation found in the previous exercise exceeds the value found
in Section \@ref(sec:regimp). This seems odd since the correlation of
the imputed values under regression imputation is equal to 1, and hence the 
imputed data have a maximal contribution to the overall correlation.

1. Can you explain why this could happen?

2. Adapt the code from the previous exercise to test your explanation. 
   Was your explanation satisfactory?

3. If not, can you think of another reason, and test that?
   Hint: Find out what is special about the solutions with the
   largest correlations.

```

```{exercise, name = "Nonlinear model", label = "nonlinear"}
The model fitted to the `airquality` data in Section \@ref(sec:miexample) 
is a simple linear model. Inspection of the residuals reveals that 
there is a slight curvature in the average of the residuals.

1. Start from the completed cases, and use `plot(fit)` to obtain 
   diagnostic plots. Can you explain why the curvature shows up?

2. Experiment with solutions, e.g., by transforming `Ozone` or 
   by adding a quadratic term to the model. Can you make the 
   curvature disappear? Does the amount of explained variance 
   increase?

3. Does the curvature also show up in the imputed data? If so, 
   does the same solution work? Hint: You can assess the 
   $j^\mathrm{th}$ fitted model by `getfit(fit, j)`, where
   `fit` was created by `with(imp,...)`.

4. Advanced: Do you think your solution would necessitate
   drawing new imputations?

```
